As evening approaches, households typically engage in their routine activities, which often include preparing meals. This situation aligns more naturally with the daily routine of preparing dinner rather than an annual event like celebrating the new year. Celebrating the new year is a rare and specific occasion, while preparing dinner is a common, everyday activity.

The evidence suggests that dinner preparation is a more plausible result in this context.

Hibernation in bears is primarily driven by biological survival mechanisms. During winter, food becomes scarce, and low temperatures make it difficult for bears to maintain their body temperature and energy levels. As a result, they enter a state of hibernation to conserve energy and survive through the period of scarcity. This behavior is not a result of following trends set by other animals but rather a direct adaptation to environmental conditions.
