 The statement asks whether A influences B through some mediator(s). Let's reason through this based on the given information about correlations and conditional independencies.

1. **Correlation Relationships**: A correlates with B, C, D, and E. Similarly, B correlates with C, D, and E. This suggests that A and B are connected, but it doesn't yet clarify whether the relationship is direct or mediated.

2. **Conditional Independencies**:
   - C and E are independent given A and B, and also independent given A, B, and D. This tells us that once we know A and B, C and E do not provide additional information about each other.
   - D and E are independent given A and B, and also independent given A, B, and C. This implies that once A and B are known, D and E do not add any further influence over each other.

   These independencies suggest that the relationships between variables are conditional, possibly implying a complex interaction but without directly stating that a mediator is necessary between A and B.

3. **No Direct Evidence of Mediation**: The problem specifies conditional independencies between some variables given others, but there is no clear indication of a mediating variable between A and B. The provided conditions do not imply a mediation relationship but rather highlight correlations and conditional independencies.

Given that no mediating variable is directly implicated between A and B from the given information, the truth value of the statement "A influences B through some mediator(s)" cannot be definitively concluded as true (entailment) or false (contradiction). Instead, the information is insufficient to prove or disprove mediation.

To address this question, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and conditional independencies given in the system of variables.

### Reasoning:

1. **Correlations**:
   - A correlates with B, D, and E.
   - B correlates with D and E.
   - C correlates with D and E.
   - D correlates with E.
   - **Key point**: Correlation alone does not imply direct causality.

2. **Independencies**:
   - A is independent of C, and A and C are independent given B.
   - B is independent of C, and B and C are independent given A.
   - **Key point**: These independencies suggest that A and B act as mediators or common causes of C, D, and E.

3. **Conditional Independence of D and E**:
   - D and E are independent given A, B, and C. 
   - **Key point**: This implies that once we condition on A, B, and C, the relationship between D and E disappears, meaning any observed correlation between D and E is likely due to shared causes (A, B, and C), not a direct causal effect from D to E.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditional independence of D and E when controlling for A, B, and C, it is unlikely that D directly affects E. Instead, their observed correlation can be explained by the influence of other variables.

The correct final result is:

#### contradiction
