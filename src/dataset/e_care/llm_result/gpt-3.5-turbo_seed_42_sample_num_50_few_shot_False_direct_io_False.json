It is a reasonable assumption that patients would trust an experienced doctor due to their expertise and knowledge in the field. Trust in a doctor is often established through positive interactions, successful treatments, and a good reputation.\n\nFor statement B (His violets only bloom in autumn), this is a factual statement about Tom's violets. This suggests a seasonal pattern in the blooming of the violets, indicating that they thrive or bloom best in autumn.\n\nGiven the reasoning provided above, it is more likely that statement A (Patients trust Tom) is true as it is based on Tom's profession as a doctor and the trust generally associated with healthcare professionals.

This scenario is less likely in the context of cloning experiments because drones are haploid, meaning they develop from unfertilized eggs and have a different genetic makeup compared to the queen and worker bees. Cloning experiments typically involve producing genetic copies of organisms through asexual reproduction, which is not applicable to drones due to their unique reproductive biology.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Some people were responsible for producing genetic copies\" aligns more closely with the concept of cloning experiments. Cloning typically involves producing genetically identical copies of an organism by replicating its DNA or cells in a laboratory setting.

Dehydration is a common side effect of Prednisone due to its impact on fluid balance in the body.\n\nStomachache is also a known side effect of Prednisone. The medication can irritate the lining of the stomach and increase the risk of developing stomach ulcers, which can cause abdominal pain.\n\nGiven the side effects of Prednisone, both dehydration and stomachache are plausible outcomes after consuming the medication.
