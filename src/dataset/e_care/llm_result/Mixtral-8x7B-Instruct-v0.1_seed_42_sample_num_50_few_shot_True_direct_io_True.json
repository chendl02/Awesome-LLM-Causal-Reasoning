The option (A) \"Tom compared the two set of codes as evidence in public\" is more likely to be true since comparing the codes would provide evidence and help people evaluate the claims. On the other hand, option (B) \"Tom cleared the two set of codes as evidence in public\" doesn't make much sense in this context since clearing codes or evidence wouldn't contribute to proving the claims regarding code copying.","label":"A","mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1_label":"B","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\nIt made a difference in its life.\nA.
