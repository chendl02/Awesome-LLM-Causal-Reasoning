Robots may have more localized or isolated systems that might handle errors differently, such as through redundancy or error-checking systems, possibly leading to degradation but not complete failure.\n\nConsidering the context of a technician setting wrong commands, the immediate and total failure of a mainframe due to critical command errors aligns more directly with the severity that such errors can cause.\n\n#### A","label":"B","gpt-4o_label":"A","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nTom wants to go to space.\\nA.

Alcohol addiction often leads to a lack of control over various aspects of one's life, including personal relationships, employment, and health.

Not everyone who is addicted to alcohol will experience alcohol poisoning, but they are highly likely to face challenges in controlling their life.\n\nGiven these considerations, the more likely scenario associated with alcohol addiction is the inability to control one's life due to the pervasive and ongoing effects of the addiction.\n\n#### A","label":"A","gpt-4o_label":"A","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nTom wants to go to space.\\nA.
