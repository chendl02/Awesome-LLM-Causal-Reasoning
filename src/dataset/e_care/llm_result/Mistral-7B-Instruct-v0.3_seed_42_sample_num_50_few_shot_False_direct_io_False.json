Therefore, the cutting of the wood does not directly cause gibbons to rest on the tree, nor does it induce the worker to acquire a large amount of cellulose.\n\nGibbons are arboreal primates and usually live in tropical and subtropical regions, not in regions with human activities like cutting wood.
