In such a climate, the primary need for staying warm in buildings is through proper insulation to retain heat and prevent it from escaping.\n\nInstalling heat insulation panels in buildings is a common and effective method to keep the indoor spaces warm during cold winters. Insulation helps conserve the heat generated within the buildings, reducing energy consumption and providing a comfortable living or working environment.\n\nOn the other hand, buying a lot of air conditioners, which are typically used for cooling, would not be the best solution for keeping warm in winter.
