This is because a rotten root system can impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to wilted leaves.\n* On the other hand, giving a plant a rhizoid (option A) might not be a direct consequence of a rotten root. Rhizoids are small, root-like structures that can help with water absorption, but they might not be a typical response to a rotten root.
