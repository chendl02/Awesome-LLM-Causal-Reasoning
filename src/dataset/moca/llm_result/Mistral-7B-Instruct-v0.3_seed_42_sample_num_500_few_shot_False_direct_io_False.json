They had met four years before when Tina was a counsellor with the Canadian Paraplegic Association, had fallen in love, and were married one year later. On this particular evening, Eugene had phoned to request a cab to take them downtown. When the taxi driver arrived, Eugene and Tina were waiting by the street. On seeing that they were both in wheelchairs, the taxi driver refused their fare because he thought it would be too crowded in the taxi with both of them and the wheelchairs. So the taxi driver headed back downtown without them. Because there was no time to call another cab, Eugene and Tina took Tina's car, which was equipped with special hand controls. In order to get downtown from their house, they had to travel across a bridge over Rupert River. A severe storm the night before had weakened the structure of the bridge. About 5 minutes before Eugene and Tina reached it, a section of the bridge collapsed. The taxi driver had reached the bridge shortly before them, and had driven off the collapsed bridge. He barely managed to escape from his taxi before it sank in the river. In the dark, Eugene and Tina drove off the collapsed bridge and their car plummeted into the river below. They both drowned.

The removal of the emails can be explained by the company's policy that allows two logged-in users to delete the spam emails when they are logged in simultaneously. Zoe, who logged in at 9 am in violation of the policy, was the one who triggered the condition that led to the deletion of the spam emails, not Alice. However, it is indirectly related to Alice's action of logging in at the same time.

While the polar bear's inability to finish its homework was ultimately the result of this action, it's important to note that other factors, such as the bear and the hedgehog both taking pencils previously, directly contributed to the lack of pencils in the box. Thus, the hedgehog's actions led to the outcome, even though other factors were also involved.
