He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. \nQuestion: Did John's decision to change jobs cause his premature death?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. \nQuestion: Did Benni cause the plant to dry out?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: \"I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can.\" Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: \"What? You funneled A X200R into the blue can? But you told me you had funneled it into the green can! That's why I always used the green can!\" Alex replies: \"Did I? Then I am sorry!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. \nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion.

In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. After some interrogation, Alex finally confesses that he had told Benni that Tom wanted them to buy and use the chemical B Y33R instead of A X200R. He wanted Benni to use the wrong fertilizer and to get fired because he wanted to have more working hours to earn more money. He himself only used A X200R. Benni tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both gardeners to use A X200R.

Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach.

In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Anne regularly uses their account from her laptop on Saturdays. Todd, however, normally doesn't watch TV at all on the weekends. This Saturday, unexpectedly, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instructions and only bought and used the chemical A X200R. However, Benni tells him that he had used the chemical B Y33R instead. He still had some bottles of this chemical in stock at home and wanted to use them up. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. \nQuestion: Did Alex cause the plant to dry out?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Granger's score was the 20th highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A.

Both were partially paralyzed and confined to wheelchairs. They had met four years before when Tina was a counsellor with the Canadian Paraplegic Association, had fallen in love, and were married one year later. On this particular evening, Eugene had phoned to request a cab to take them downtown. When the taxi driver arrived, Eugene and Tina were waiting by the street. On seeing that they were both in wheelchairs, the taxi driver refused their fare because he thought it would be too crowded in the taxi with both of them and the wheelchairs. So the taxi driver headed back downtown without them. Because there was no time to call another cab, Eugene and Tina took Tina's car, which was equipped with special hand controls. In order to get downtown from their house, they had to travel across a bridge over Rupert River. A severe storm the night before had weakened the structure of the bridge. About 5 minutes before Eugene and Tina reached it, a section of the bridge collapsed. The taxi driver had reached the bridge about 15 minutes before them, and made it safely across. In the dark, Eugene and Tina drove off the collapsed bridge and their car plummeted into the river below. They both drowned. Their bodies were retrieved from the car the next morning. \nQuestion: Did the taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina cause their death?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach.

In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally.

She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance.

He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instructions and only bought and used the chemical A X200R. However, Benni tells him that he had used the chemical B Y33R instead.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: \"I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can.\" Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: \"What? You funneled A X200R into the blue can? But you told me you had funneled it into the green can! That's why I always used the green can!\" Alex replies: \"Did I? Then I am sorry!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. \nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack).

He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. \nQuestion: Did long-term exposure to asbestos cause John's premature death?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: \"I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule.\" Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. \nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack).

The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug.

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack).

The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug.
