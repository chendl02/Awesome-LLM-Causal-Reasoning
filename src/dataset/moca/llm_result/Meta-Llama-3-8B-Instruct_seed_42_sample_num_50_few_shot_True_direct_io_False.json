He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. \nQuestion: Did John's decision to change jobs cause his premature death?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: \"I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule.\" Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R.

The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. \nQuestion: Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct":"Story: In Bash Ball, opposing teams try to score points in the other team's zone by entering it. On each team, there are two types of players: Bashers and Runners. During the game, Bashers remain in the same spot, trying to hit the other team's Runners with balls, and Runners try to enter the other team's zone without getting hit. Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is not allowed to talk to Runners, Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the remainder of the game.\n\nQuestion: Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was?\n\nReasoning: Harmon was hit by the Bash Ball, and this caused him to be out for the rest of the game. If Zach had told Harmon where the other team's Basher was, Harmon would have been able to avoid being hit. However, Zach did not tell Harmon, and Harmon was hit anyway. This suggests that Zach's action or inaction did not cause Harmon to be out.\n\nEvidence: The fact that the other team had at least one Basher behind the tree, and Harmon was a Runner, meant that Harmon was already at risk of being hit. Zach's failure to disclose this information did not increase the risk of Harmon getting hit, as Harmon was already vulnerable to being hit. Furthermore, Harmon's chances of being out would not change regardless of whether Zach told him about the other team's Basher or not.\n\nTherefore, Harmon was not out of the game because Zach did not tell him where the other team's Basher was.\n\n#### No","label":"no","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct_label":"no","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct":"Story: Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered.\n\nQuestion: Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?\n\nThe key question here is whether the misadministration of medication was the cause of John's premature death. The story highlights John's long history of working with asbestos, which ultimately led to his incurable lung cancer. Despite the diagnosis, John's death occurs shortly after the misadministration of medication.\n\nHowever, the evidence suggests that John's death was primarily caused by his lung cancer, which was a direct consequence of his asbestos exposure. The medication was an accidental event, which was likely a contributing factor to his cardiac arrest and death. However, it is not the underlying cause of his death.\n\n#### No","label":"yes","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct_label":"no","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. \nQuestion: Did the nurse's carelessness cause John's premature death?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.
