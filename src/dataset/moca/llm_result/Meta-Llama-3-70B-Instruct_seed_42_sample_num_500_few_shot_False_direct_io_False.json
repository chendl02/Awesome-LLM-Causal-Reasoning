In this case, the coin flip is a necessary but not sufficient condition for Alex to win. In other words, Alex can only win if the coin comes up heads, but the coin coming up heads does not guarantee that Alex will win.\n\nWe can see this by analyzing the causal graph underlying the game. The graph would have three nodes: \"Coin Flip\" (heads or tails), \"Dice Roll\" (total > 11 or not), and \"Win\" (Alex wins or loses). There would be an edge from \"Coin Flip\" to \"Win\" (since the coin flip affects the win condition) and an edge from \"Dice Roll\" to \"Win\" (since the dice roll affects the win condition). However, there is no edge between \"Coin Flip\" and \"Dice Roll\" since the coin flip does not directly affect the dice roll, and vice versa.\n\nGiven this causal structure, we can apply the concept of intervention in causal inference. Imagine we had intervened on the coin flip, forcing it to come up heads. Would Alex still have won? Not necessarily, since the dice roll is independent of the coin flip. Alex still needed to roll a total greater than 11 to win.\n\nIn this scenario, it was a combination of the coin flip coming up heads and the dice roll being greater than 11 that led to Alex's win.

Considering John's incurable lung cancer, it's likely that he would have died within the estimated 2 months, even without the medication error.\n2. **Temporal relationship**: The medication error occurred immediately before John's death, which suggests a temporal relationship between the two events.

We know that Alice was also logged in at 9 am, violating the policy. In this counterfactual scenario, the deletion of emails would still have occurred because Alice's login at 9 am would have triggered the deletion.\n2. **Causal mechanism:** The deletion of emails is triggered by two people logging in to the central computer at the same time.
