The receptionist had previously reminded the faculty members, including Professor Smith, that only administrative assistants were allowed to take pens.\n3. The problem arose because there were no pens left on the receptionist's desk when she needed to take an important message.\n\nThe key question is whether Professor Smith's action of taking a pen caused the problem. To determine this, let's consider a counterfactual scenario: if Professor Smith had not taken a pen, would the receptionist still have had pens available?\n\nGiven that the administrative assistants typically take pens and the receptionist's desk was stocked with pens initially, it's likely that there were multiple pens available. If Professor Smith had not taken a pen, it's possible that the receptionist would still have had pens left, assuming the administrative assistants didn't take all of them.\n\nHowever, the story doesn't provide information on the exact number of pens taken by Professor Smith and the administrative assistant. It's possible that the administrative assistant took multiple pens, leaving none for the receptionist, even if Professor Smith hadn't taken any.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, we can say that Professor Smith's action of taking a pen contributed to the problem of there being no pens left. However, it's not clear whether his action was the sole cause or whether the administrative assistant's actions were sufficient to cause the problem on their own.\n\nBased on the information provided, it's reasonable to conclude that Professor Smith's action played a role in the problem, but we can't determine with certainty whether it was the sole cause or a contributing factor.\n\nHowever, the answer format requires a Yes or No answer.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To determine if the machine broke down because Kate did not put oil in the machine, we need to establish cause and effect in the context of responsibilities and actions taken.\n\n1. **Chain of Responsibility**: The primary responsibility for putting oil in the machines lies with Janet, as she works in the maintenance department and it is explicitly her job to ensure this task is completed.\n\n2. **Backup Responsibility**: Kate, working in the human resources department, has the secondary responsibility to put oil in the machines only if Janet fails to do so.

However, Kate also did not put oil in the machine, failing to fulfill her secondary responsibility.\n\n4. **Outcome**: The machine broke down, a consequence typically associated with not being properly lubricated.\n\nGiven these points, to understand if Kate's inaction directly led to the machine breakdown, we have to consider whether her failure to put oil in the machine (after Janet failed to do so) was a sufficient cause for the breakdown.\n\nThe machine breaking down was a direct consequence of not being oiled, which was Kate's responsibility to ensure after Janet failed to do so. Thus, Kate's decision not to put oil in the machine, considering she was the last line of responsibility in this scenario, can be linked to the cause of the machine breaking down.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that both Janet's initial failure and Kate's subsequent inaction contributed to the outcome. The critical question is whether Kate's inaction, under the given circumstances, can be singled out as a cause.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To determine whether Jack caused the climber to fall off the side of the road, we need to consider the circumstances and the concept of causation.\n\nFirst, let's establish that the rock climber would have fallen off the road unless he was able to use the cord to save himself. Jack's car had a cord hanging out, which could have been used by the climber to prevent his fall if Jack had slowed down.\n\nHowever, slowing down would have resulted in the death of the five sick people due to delayed medical treatment. This presents a moral dilemma, but for the purpose of determining causation, we focus on the direct causal chain.\n\nJack's action (or decision) to keep driving quickly did not directly cause the rock climber to fall. The climber's fall was the result of his own precarious situation and his inability to use the cord in time. If the cord had not been there at all, or if Jack's car had not approached the scene, the climber would still have fallen. Jack's presence and actions did not create the risk of the climber falling; the risk was already present due to the climber's situation.\n\nMoreover, if we consider counterfactual reasoning, which is a key aspect of understanding causation, we ask what would have happened if Jack had not been there or had not driven past that point. The climber would still have been in danger of falling and, without another means of saving himself, likely would have fallen. Jack's actions did not introduce a new risk but were part of a scenario where multiple unfortunate circumstances converged.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, Jack's decision to keep driving did not cause the climber to fall off the side of the road.

Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up.

Billy's action (ignoring his red signal and moving his train onto the bridge) was also sufficient to cause the bridge to collapse. However, since both events happened simultaneously and either action alone was enough to bring down the bridge, the question arises as to whether Billy's action was necessary for the bridge's collapse.\n\nHowever, because Suzy's action on its own would have led to the collapse, and Billy's action did not prevent or mitigate the collapse caused by Suzy's train, we conclude that Billy's action was not necessary for the bridge to collapse.\n\nBut, since either train driving onto the bridge was by itself enough to cause the collapse, and Billy\u2019s action contributed to the scenario that led to the collapse (even though it was not necessary given that Suzy's train would have done it anyway), we can consider Billy\u2019s action as a contributing cause, and in many contexts, determining someone's responsibility in legal or other frameworks might consider their actions as parts of the causes leading to the outcome.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing on whether Billy was a cause, even if not the sole necessary cause, in traditional philosophical and legal terms, contributing to a causal chain leading to an outcome is often enough to ascribe cause.\n\n#### Yes","label":"yes","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"yes","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 11 or the spinner lands on green. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11, and the spinner lands on green.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To investigate the question, let's analyze the events described in the narrative.\n\n\nBenni used chemical B Y33R because he was told by Alex to use this fertilizer instead of A X200R. Alex had intentionally misled Benni to achieve personal gain while using A X200R him. Benni had no information that this was against Tom's intentions.\n\nThe main reason behind the plant damage, as per the magazine, is the use of multiple different chemicals on the plants.\n\n\nSince the application of both chemicals A X200R and B Y33R led to the drying of the plants, from a causal viewpoint, Benni's action was a necessary condition for this specific outcome. Benni's use of B Y33R without the proper knowledge of the situation and the original instruction contributed directly to this outcome.\n\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Alex's deliberate misinformation was the root cause of the error.

In this instance, both conditions were met: Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 11, and the coin came up heads.\n\nWhile it is true that Alex would not have won if the coin had come up tails (i.e., condition 2 would not have been met), this does not mean that the coin flip was the sole cause of his win. The dice roll was also crucial, and in fact, it is explicitly stated that it is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, yet he did.\n\nThus, the outcome where Alex wins is the result of both the combination of rolling a high number on the dice and the favorable outcome of the coin flip. To ascribe his win solely to the coin flip ignores the critical role the dice played in achieving the winning conditions.\n\nTherefore, while the coin flip was necessary for Alex's win (because without it coming up heads, he wouldn't have won), it is not accurate to say he won because of the coin flip alone. Both the dice roll and the coin flip contributed to his win.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the question in a manner that seeks to understand if the coin flip was a necessary condition without which Alex wouldn't have won, then the answer is yes.

According to the poison's properties, it would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption, and its lethal effects would start around 30 minutes to an hour after ingestion, depending on the victim's body weight.\n\nSecond, the car crash: Mr. Wallace died in the car explosion due to fatal burns, as reported by the coroner.

The coroner's report confirmed the presence of fatal burns from the car explosion, which strongly suggests that the immediate cause of death was related to the crash rather than the poison alone.\n\nThe poison contributed to Mr. Wallace's weakened state or might have eventually led to his death, but based on the timeline and the specific cause of death detailed in the coroner's report, the car crash and explosion were the immediate actions that led to his death.\n\n#### Yes","label":"yes","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"yes","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him.

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. \nQuestion: Did the nurse's carelessness cause John's premature death?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

This condition was terminal, and the doctors had confirmed that it was absolutely certain to kill him very soon, with an estimated time frame of no more than 2 months.\n\nThe cardiac arrest caused by the wrong medication administered by the new nurse appears to have triggered John's immediate death.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To determine whether Joe caused his son's injury, we need to examine the causal chain of events. Joe's generosity led him to help the injured person in the parking lot, which delayed his arrival to pick up his son. This delay resulted in the neighbor taking the child home instead, and subsequently, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver, leading to Joe's son's injury.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider whether Joe's action was a sufficient and necessary condition for the injury. It is clear that Joe's delay created an opportunity for the neighbor to take the child home and, ultimately, for the accident to occur.\n\nBut, an important aspect of this scenario is that Joe's generosity is described as a basic trait of his personality, something he cannot help, even when he tries hard. This implies that his action was not entirely under his control. It was a natural response to seeing someone in need, driven by his inherent character rather than a deliberate choice.\n\nTherefore, while it is correct that Joe's delay led to the accident, we need to consider his moral responsibility for the outcome. In many accounts of causality, the concept of \"causation\" implies not only the physical sequence of events but also a level of agency or control. In this case, Joe acted without intending harm and in accordance with his immutable personality trait.\n\nSo, while Joe's actions were a causal factor in the sequence of events, considering his inherent generosity and lack of control over his response, we can reason that he did not \"cause\" the injury in a morally imputable sense.\n\n#### No","label":"no","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"no","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

We also know that Mr. Carlson chose the Moules Mariniere for Karen, which was made in a wine sauce.\n\nIf Mr. Carlson had chosen the Scallops Meuniere instead, it is likely that Karen would not have died, as this dish did not contain any wine. The fact that the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce was the key factor that led to Karen's allergic reaction and subsequent death.\n\nNow, let's consider whether Mr. Carlson's choice of dish was the cause of Karen's death. The crucial point is that Mr. Carlson's choice of the Moules Mariniere was a necessary condition for Karen's death. If he had not chosen this dish, the allergic reaction would not have occurred.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that Mr. Carlson did not intentionally try to harm Karen. He did not know about Karen's medical condition, and he did not know that the Moules Mariniere contained wine sauce.\n\nDespite this lack of intent, we can still analyze the causal chain of events. The fact remains that Mr. Carlson's choice of dish led to Karen consuming the wine sauce, which in turn caused her allergic reaction and death.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mr. Carlson did not intentionally cause Karen's death, his choice of dish was still the direct cause of her demise.\n\n#### Yes","label":"yes","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"yes","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

However, he does turn on his lamp at 8 PM on Thursday.\n\nThe crucial factor here is that Carol and Bob, who are allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays, also turned on their lamps at the same time. This means that, even if Jim hadn't turned on his lamp, the breaker would still have failed if Carol and Bob had turned on their lamps while someone else (e.g., Nancy) was already using her lamp.\n\nHowever, since Jim did turn on his lamp at the same time as Carol and Bob, his action contributed to the total number of lamps turned on, which reached the threshold of three. In this sense, Jim's action was a necessary part of the combination of events that led to the breaker failing.\n\nBut, to establish causality, we need to examine what would have happened if Jim hadn't turned on his lamp. If Jim hadn't turned on his lamp, and Carol and Bob still turned on their lamps, the breaker might still have failed if someone else (Nancy) had also turned on her lamp. However, we don't have information about Nancy's actions. \n\nBut to establish causality in general terms, we ask what would have happened if Jim hadn't turned on his lamp, with Carol and Bob still turning on theirs? In this scenario, only two people would have turned on their lamps (Carol and Bob), and the breaker wouldn't have failed.\n\nSince we don't have evidence that other people were using their lamps at the time, we can assume that the situation would have remained under the threshold of three lamps if Jim hadn't turned on his lamp.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, we can conclude that Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM contributed to the breaker failure, since it added to the number of lamps turned on and pushed the total to three. \n\n#### Yes","label":"yes","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"yes","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To solve this causal inference problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Condition for Short Circuit**: The machine will short circuit if and only if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time.\n\n2. **Role of the Black Wire**: The black wire is designated to touch the battery and is part of the normal operation of the machine. Its touching the battery alone is not enough to cause a short circuit.\n\n3. **Incident Occurrence**: In this scenario, both the black wire and the red wire end up touching the battery, leading to a short circuit.\n\n4. **Causal Analysis**: To determine if the black wire caused the short circuit, we need to analyze if the black wire touching the battery was a necessary and sufficient condition for the short circuit to occur. However, touching the battery is its intended function and does not alone cause a short circuit. The necessary condition for the short circuit is the concurrent contact of both the black wire and the red wire with the battery.\n\nConsidering these points, the black wire's action (touching the battery) was necessary for the short circuit to occur because the machine's setup requires both wires to touch the battery for a short circuit to happen. However, the black wire's action alone (its touching the battery) is not sufficient to cause a short circuit, as this is its normal function. The critical factor here is the concurrent action of the red wire also touching the battery.\n\nTherefore, while the black wire's touching the battery was part of the causal chain leading to the short circuit, pinpointing the black wire as the singular cause of the short circuit overlooks the critical contribution of the red wire's inappropriate contact with the battery.\n\nThus, the answer is nuanced, but the format requires a binary choice. Considering the explanation, the black wire's role was necessary but within its intended function, suggesting that attributing causation solely to it without acknowledging the role of the red wire might be misleading. However, based on the logic that both wires were necessary for the short circuit and without one (in this case, the black wire), the outcome would not have occurred as it did:\n\n#### Yes","label":"yes","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"yes","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The machine is designed so that both wires move around inside the machine. The black wire is supposed to touch the battery at certain times as it moves around inside the machine. The red wire is never supposed to touch the battery as it moves around inside the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both come in contact with the battery at the exact same time. There is a short circuit. \nQuestion: Did the black wire cause the short circuit?\nBegin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To answer this question, let's break down the situation.\n\nThe biology class is graded on a curve, meaning that the distribution of grades is fixed: 20 students will receive an A, 20 will receive a B, 20 will receive a C, and 20 will receive a D. Granger's score is the 20th highest in the class, earning him a grade of A. This means that if Granger had not scored as high as he did, or if he had not taken the test at all, the number of students receiving an A would have been fewer than 20, and the number of students receiving a B would have been more than 20.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the grade distribution is fixed, and the cutoff for an A grade is not absolute but rather relative to the performance of others. The 21st student, the pre-med student, would have received an A only if Granger had scored lower. In other words, Granger's score did indeed \"take\" one of the A slots, but the availability of A slots was fixed.\n\nIt is reported that the pre-med student missed the GPA cutoff for medical school by .07 GPA points. This implies that the pre-med student needed a higher GPA (and, by extension, an A in the biology class) to meet the medical school's requirements.\n\nNow, did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff? The issue lies not in whether Granger's score was higher than the pre-med student's, but rather whether the fact that the grade distribution was fixed necessarily links Granger's performance to the pre-med student's failure to meet the cutoff.\n\nIt is the structure of the grading system, combined with the fixed class size and the fixed grade distribution, that ultimately determines the cutoff for each grade. The mere fact that Granger received a grade of A in itself didn't \"cause\" the pre-med student to fail to meet the cutoff in a direct, singular sense; rather, Granger's score was one of many that contributed to the fixed distribution of grades in the class.\n\nThis scenario illustrates a classic issue in the philosophy of causation, often referred to as the \"preemption problem\" or, more generally, the problem of \"overdetermination.\" Here, multiple conditions \"preempt\" one another\u2014all 20 A grades were ultimately going to be awarded, regardless of the precise distribution of those grades. Thus, while it might be tempting to say that Granger's high score contributed to the pre-med student's disadvantage, in a causal sense, it's more accurate to understand Granger's role as merely one component in a complex causal structure.\n\n#### No","label":"no","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"no","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To determine whether Granger caused the pre-med student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff, we need to consider the causal relationship between Granger's action (not cheating and achieving the 20th-highest score) and the pre-med student's outcome (missing the GPA cutoff).\n\nThe key factor here is the grading system, which is curved such that the top 20 students receive an A, the next 20 a B, and so on. Since Granger's score was the 20th-highest, he effectively \"took\" one of the available A's. This means that the pre-med student, who would have received an A if Granger had not achieved the 20th-highest score, was bumped down to a B.\n\nIn this scenario, Granger's action did not directly cause the pre-med student to miss the medical school cutoff. Instead, it was the grading system and the fact that there were only 20 available A's that led to the pre-med student's outcome. However, it is arguable that Granger's achievement of the 20th-highest score did contribute to the pre-med student's GPA being lower than it would have been if he had not done so well.\n\nWhile this is not a straightforward case of causality, it is reasonable to conclude that Granger's action did play a role in determining the pre-med student's GPA, which in turn affected their eligibility for medical school.\n\nHowever, if we have to select a binary yes\/no response.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct":"To address this question, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System's Behavior:** The central computer has a specific behavior when two people are logged in at the same time - it sends an empty email to a non-existent email address. This behavior is not triggered by a single login but requires the simultaneous login of two individuals.\n\n2. **Sequence of Events:** Zoe logs in first at 9 am. At this point, Alice has not yet logged in. After Zoe's login, there is no immediate report of an empty email being sent, suggesting that Zoe's login alone does not trigger the email sending behavior.\n\n3. **Alice Logs In:** Alice logs in at 9:30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. It is at this point that an empty email is sent to a non-existent email address.\n\n4. **Causal Analysis:** Given that the system's behavior (sending an empty email) is only triggered when two people are logged in simultaneously, and considering that the email was sent immediately after Alice logged in (when Zoe was already logged in), it is crucial to establish causality. Zoe's login was a necessary condition for the email to be sent because her ongoing login allowed for the simultaneous login condition to be met when Alice logged in. Without Zoe's prior login, the condition for sending the email (simultaneous logins) would not have been met, even with Alice's later login.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Zoe's action of logging in first was a necessary condition for the event to occur. However, it is essential to recognize that the system's behavior was triggered by the combination of both Zoe's and Alice's actions. Zoe's login alone did not send the email, but her logged-in state at the time of Alice's login was critical for the simultaneous login condition to be satisfied. Therefore, while Zoe's action was a necessary component in the causal chain leading to the sending of the empty email, it is reasonable to argue that Zoe did cause the email to be sent in the context of being a necessary part of the causal scenario, especially considering that her action (logging in) was part of the required conditions for the system's behavior to be triggered.\n\n#### Yes","label":"no","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct_label":"yes","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nStory: Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers.

This suggests that Ed's action of driving quickly is a necessary condition for the rock to fall.\n\nSecondly, the presence of the cord and the rock's position by the side of the road are pre-existing conditions that set the stage for the event.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni.
