However, since poverty is unobserved, we cannot directly adjust for it in our analysis.\n  \n- **Method 1:** By looking at the correlation between water quality and cholera on a case-by-case basis according to poverty, we are attempting to control for the unobserved confounder (poverty). This method implicitly assumes that we can infer poverty levels from other observed characteristics in each case. However, without direct observation of poverty, this method may not effectively control for the confounder, leading to biased estimates.\n\n- **Method 2:** By looking at the general correlation between water quality and cholera without attempting to control for poverty, we are accepting that the observed correlation may be confounded by poverty. This method is straightforward but acknowledges the limitation of unobserved confounders.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that poverty is unobserved and acts as a confounder, neither method is perfect.

It provides a broader perspective on how appearance and talent relate to each other without the bias introduced by fame.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Correctness**: Method 2 is more appropriate for understanding the direct relationship between appearance and talent because it avoids the selection bias introduced by focusing only on famous individuals, who are by definition high in both appearance and talent.
