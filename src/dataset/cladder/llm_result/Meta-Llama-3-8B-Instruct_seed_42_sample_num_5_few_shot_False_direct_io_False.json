Since muvy is not present, it means that only swoq can cause kwoz.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct":"To determine whether smoking negatively affects freckles, we need to analyze the probability of freckles in smokers compared to nonsmokers, while disregarding the mediation effect through effort.\n\nFrom the given conditions, we can construct a table to compare the probability of freckles for smokers and nonsmokers:\n\n|  | Lazy | Hard-Working |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nonsmoker | 92% | 50% |\n| Smoker | 80% | 36% |\n\nAs we can see, smokers tend to have a lower probability of freckles (80% and 36%) compared to nonsmokers (92% and 50%).

For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 74%, whereas for nonsmokers, it is 17%. This means that smokers are more likely to be hard-working than nonsmokers, which can contribute to the observed differences in freckles.\n\nTo disentangle this effect, we can calculate the expected probability of freckles for smokers and nonsmokers, given that they are hard-working:\n\nExpected probability of freckles for hard-working smokers: 36% (as per the table)\nExpected probability of freckles for hard-working nonsmokers: 50% (as per the table)\nExpected probability of freckles for all smokers: 0.74 \u00d7 36% + 0.26 \u00d7 80% \u2248 48.2%\nExpected probability of freckles for all nonsmokers: 0.17 \u00d7 50% + 0.83 \u00d7 92% \u2248 83.1%\n\nNow we can compare the expected probabilities: 48.2% (smokers) < 83.1% (nonsmokers).
