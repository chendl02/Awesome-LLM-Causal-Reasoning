This means that when the husband does not set the alarm, the probability of the alarm ringing is low.\n\n2. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of the alarm ringing is much higher at 52%.

{"gpt-3.5-turbo":"In this scenario, we can analyze the relationship between pexu and rukz to determine whether rukz is less likely than not rukz overall. \n\nGiven that Kraz has a direct effect on pexu and rukz, Hwax has a direct effect on pexu, and pexu has a direct effect on rukz, we can infer the following causal chain: Kraz -> pexu -> rukz.\n\nBased on the provided information:\n- The overall probability of pexu is 28%.\n- For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 84%.\n- For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 56%.\n\nSince rukz can be influenced by both being pexu and not being pexu, we need to consider both cases:\n1. For individuals who are not pexu:\n   - Probability of rukz = 84%\n2. For individuals who are pexu:\n   - Probability of rukz = 56%\n\nTo determine the overall probability of rukz, we need to consider the weighted average based on the proportion of people who are pexu and not pexu.\n\nGiven that the overall probability of pexu is 28%, and the complement (not pexu) is 72%, we can calculate the overall probability of rukz as:\n(0.28 * 0.56) + (0.72 * 0.84) = 0.1568 + 0.6048 = 0.7616 or 76.16%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rukz is greater than not rukz overall.\n\n#### No","label":"no","gpt-3.5-turbo_label":"no","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\n        Question: Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kraz has a direct effect on pexu and rukz.
