{"gpt-4o":"Coral bleaching occurs when corals lose their vibrant colors due to stress, often caused by warming sea temperatures, pollution, or other factors. This stress results in the expulsion of symbiotic algae living in their tissues, which are vital for the coral's survival and serve as a primary food source. Without these algae, corals are weakened and more susceptible to disease and death. Consequently, the health of the coral reef ecosystem deteriorates, negatively impacting the diverse marine life that depends on the reef for habitat, food, and protection.

{"gpt-4o":"Planting a garden with different types of plants that bloom in various seasons can serve multiple practical purposes, and one common reason is to maintain a continuous display of blooming plants throughout the year. This approach provides aesthetic appeal and creates an enjoyable and vibrant garden space in every season. Additionally, having a variety of plants that bloom at different times can promote biodiversity by supporting diverse pollinators and wildlife throughout the year.\n\nParticipating in a scientific experiment to study the effects of cross-seasonal pollination is a more specialized and less common motivation for most families planting a garden.\n\nTherefore, the more plausible cause is the desire to ensure a continuous cycle of blooming plants throughout the year.\n\n#### B","label":"B","gpt-4o_label":"B","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\\nAs evening approaches, households engage in their routine culinary activities.\\nWhat's the more plausible RESULT?\\nA.
