{"deepseek-ai\/DeepSeek-V2-Chat":"The government's decision to move the public holiday to a Monday is likely aimed at promoting better utilization of time and potentially boosting local economies through increased leisure activities over the extended weekend. This policy change directly benefits individuals by allowing them to enjoy a longer period of leisure without the need to take additional leave or disrupt their work schedules.

During winter, food becomes scarce, and low temperatures make it difficult for bears to maintain their body temperature and energy levels.
