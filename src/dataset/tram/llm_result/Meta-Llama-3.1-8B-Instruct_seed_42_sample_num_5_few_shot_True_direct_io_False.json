During winter, food becomes scarce, and low temperatures make it difficult for bears to maintain their body temperature and energy levels. They hibernate to conserve energy needed to survive through the period.\n\nSince temperatures are going up overall, the bear is likely to not need to hibernate because it has more warm periods to forage and eat, and the temperature stress is lower.
