{"mistralai\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3":" Answer: False. Radiculopathy in one spinal level (S1 on the right side) generally does not directly cause radiculopathy at a different level (T5 on the left side), unless there is a chain of pathology connecting them, such as a diseased disc or herniation that affects several nerve roots. However, it's important to note that there can be indirect associations or similarities in symptoms due to shared underlying conditions. For example, one radiculopathy might make a person more susceptible to another one, but this would not be a direct causality as described in the question.","label":"False","mistralai\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_label":"False","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\n    Question: R C5 Radikulopati causes Svalgbesv\u00e4r.\"R\" and \"L\" refer to the right and left sides of the body, respectively).Answer with true or false.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: True or Answer: False.
