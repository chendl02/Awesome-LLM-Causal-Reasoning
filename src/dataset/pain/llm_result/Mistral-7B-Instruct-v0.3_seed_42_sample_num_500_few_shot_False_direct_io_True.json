If Radiculopathy on the right (R) side causes radiculopathy on the left (L) side, it would mean that there is some sort of unilateral condition that has spread or caused a secondary effect, but the causality is not typically directly reciprocal, i.e., one affecting the other directly. However, in medicine, it's important to consider multiple factors, such as underlying conditions or traumas, that could potentially lead to such a scenario.
