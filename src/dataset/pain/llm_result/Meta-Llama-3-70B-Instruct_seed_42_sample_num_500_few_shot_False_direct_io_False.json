Although they are separate joints, they are interconnected through various muscle groups, tendons, and ligaments.\n\nOne crucial aspect to examine is the fascial and muscular connections between the lower and upper limbs. The fascial system, a network of connective tissue, spans across the entire body, influencing movement patterns and transmitting forces between joints.\n\nResearch suggests that altered movement patterns, muscle imbalances, and fascial restrictions in the lower limb can propagate to the upper limb, leading to compensatory mechanisms and potential pain patterns (1, 2).
