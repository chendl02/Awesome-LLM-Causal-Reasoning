In the case of S1 radiculopathy, pain, numbness, or weakness is typically experienced in the lower back, buttocks, and back of both legs, specifically the posterior thigh and calf, and may also affect the feet and toes.\n\nLumbar and sacral nerve roots are the main sources of sensation in the lower back and legs. During spinal nerve root irritation or damage (as is the case with radiculopathy), the affected nerve root may cause sensory, motor, or reflex changes that can manifest on the ipsilateral (same side) and\/or contralateral (opposite side) side of the body due to axon collaterals.\n\nAxon collaterals are branches that originate from a single axon and may relay signals to adjacent spinal nerve roots. For example, a left S1 radiculopathy might have a significant number of axon collaterals that innervate the right L5\/S1 area, leading to symptoms on both sides of the body.\n\nHowever, the percentage of individuals with S1 radiculopathy experiencing predominant pain on the contralateral side is generally low. In this context, the most common presenting symptoms with S1 radiculopathy include lower back pain, bilateral posterior leg pain, and sensory changes in the affected dermatomes.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned information, it is worth noting that while contralateral symptoms can occur due to axon collaterals, the incidence of left back pain caused by right S1 radiculopathy is not common. Still, it is essential to consider various factors that could contribute to the occurrence of the symptoms, as medical conditions can present differently in different individuals.\n\nBased on the available medical evidence, left back pain caused by right S1 radiculopathy is an uncommon outcome.
