There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde.

When we last wrote about Microsoft\u2019s investment in ChatGPT, it was reported by Semafor that the tech giant was looking to invest an additional $10 billion into the startup. The official release doesn\u2019t confirm or deny the rumored dollar figure, as they only commented on continuing the partnership.\\n\\nMicrosoft noted how they were committed to turning Azure into an AI supercomputer for the entire world. Microsoft Azure is the exclusive cloud provider for every tool under the OpenAI banner.\\n\\nJust as a quick reminder, ChatGPT is the chatbot released late last year by OpenAI, a company that Elon Musk and Sam Altman originally founded. This revolutionary tool reported one million users at the beginning of December after being out for about a week.\n    Article B: OpenAI has launched its first subscription plan for ChatGPT, opening up the popular AI model for premium use just two months after its public launch.\\n\\nThe new plan, called ChatGPT Plus and announced in a company blog post on Wednesday, will charge subscribers $20 for monthly use of ChatGPT\u2019s tools. Users will get priority access to ChatGPT \u201cduring peak times,\u201d faster responses and \u201cpriority access to new features and improvements,\u201d the company wrote. The subscription is only available initially in the United States and will roll out to a waitlist first.\\n\\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement. The company also noted in its post that a waitlist is now available for an upcoming ChatGPT API.\\n\\nThe move comes just weeks after OpenAI president and chairman Greg Brockman posted to the company\u2019s official Discord server asking users for input on ways to \u201cmonetize ChatGPT.\u201d Some users (including this author) reported seeing an offer for a $42 per month pro tier in January, which promised early and priority access to new features and better reliability should the service, which has suffered repeated outages due to high demand in past weeks, again hit capacity.\\n\\nAfter OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late November, more than one million users overwhelmed the tool\u2019s site within five days, OpenAI has said.

The acquisition was confirmed in an SEC filing from the company on Friday morning, noting it\u2019s delisting $TWTR from the New York Stock Exchange. He celebrated by firing executives. Musk fired Parag Agrawal, who succeeded Jack Dorsey as Twitter CEO, and chief financial officer Ned Segal, both of who were in the building at the time and escorted out by security, according to Reuters. Vijaya Gadde, the company\u2019s policy chief whom Musk had publicly criticized, was also ousted. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, is gone, too, The New York Times reports. (Bloomberg says security escorted him out, as well.) Chief customer officer Sarah Personette was not among the executives fired but announced she resigned on October 28th with a tweet thread posted the following Tuesday. In it, she mentions, \u201cI do believe the new administration understands the importance of holding up the standards of GARM.\u201d\\nThe execs were in line for handsome payouts for their trouble, Insider reports: Agrawal $38.7 million, Segal $25.4 million, Gadde $12.5 million, and Personette, who tweeted yesterday about how excited she was for Musk\u2019s takeover, $11.2 million. However, a subsequent report from The Information indicated Musk has said they\u2019re fired \u201cfor cause\u201d in an attempt to block them from receiving those payouts. It\u2019s unclear what this may mean for Personette.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

OpenAI was co-founded in 2015 by Elon Musk and Sam Altman and is backed by well-known investors \u2014 most notably Microsoft. \\n\\nIt is one of several examples of generative AI. These are tools that allow users to enter written prompts and receive new human-like text or images and videos generated by the AI.\\n\\nPrior examples include Dall-E, a text-to-image program from OpenAI that garnered attention from people captivated by its ability to come up with realistic, often absurd, pictures that match people\u2019s text descriptions.\n    Article B: Alibaba says it will launch its own ChatGPT-style tool, becoming the latest tech giant to jump on the chatbot bandwagon.\\n\\nThe Chinese behemoth said it was testing an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot internally.

Trouble is, the software provider supplied a patch back in March that should have eliminated that vulnerability. But Equifax's former CEO (who suddenly retired last week) told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that a single IT technician was at fault for the whole thing after they failed to install the patch.\\n\\nWhile speaking to the committee (video below), former CEO Richard Smith outlined the company's normal procedure for new patches: Have a technician install it and then scan the system for any remaining vulnerabilities. Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed.\\n\\nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability.\\n\\nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser.\n    Article B: \\n\\nVisa and MasterCard are issuing confidential alerts to financial institutions across the US, cautioning them that more than 200,000 credit cards were compromised in the recent Equifax data breach, according to PYMNTS. \\n\\nCompromised information included card account numbers, expiration dates, and cardholders\u2019 names, all of which can be used to conduct fraud at online retailers and perform identity theft.

There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

According to the agency, there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil so far this year \u2014 most of which erupted in the Amazon.

That's nearly as many as in all of 2018. Smoke from the fires has darkened the skies over major Brazilian cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has signaled unconcern about the situation. The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding.

But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d.

It is not, as some headlines have had it, a vendor software program.\\n\\nIt\\'s also not proven that Struts was the source of the hole the hackers drove through.\\n\\nIn fact, several headlines -- some of which have since been retracted -- all source a single quote by a non-technical analyst from an Equifax source.\\n\\nNot only is that troubling journalistically, it\\'s problematic from a technical point of view. In case you haven\\'t noticed, Equifax appears to be utterly and completely clueless about their own technology.

Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed.\\n\\nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability.\\n\\nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser.\n\n    Event 1: Equifax was using the open-source server framework, Apache Struts.\n    Event 2: Equifax failed to fix vulnerability within 48 hours.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Musk's plans for Twitter's monetization were widely discussed before the layoffs and are driven by his desire to make the platform profitable.\n\n#### D \n\n\n\n","label":"D","google\/gemma-2-27b-it_label":"D","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\n    Context:\n    Article A: Twitter has begun laying off sizable chunks of the company, the first major move by Elon Musk since his acquisition of the company was completed last week.\\n\\nTwitter told employees in an email sent Thursday evening and seen by NBC News that the company would notify staffers by email about their employment.\\n\\n\u201cWe recognize that this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions to Twitter, but this action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company\u2019s success moving forward,\u201d the email said.\\n\\nThe firings immediately prompted a class action lawsuit against Twitter for allegedly failing to give a 60-day warning of mass layoffs.\\n\\nIt had been widely reported that Musk planned to slash the company\\'s 7,500-person payroll after he finalized his $44 billion acquisition late last week.

{"google\/gemma-2-27b-it":"While both events involve OpenAI and ChatGPT, there's not enough evidence to suggest a direct causal link between Microsoft's investment and OpenAI's decision to launch a subscription plan. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **OpenAI's Financial Needs:** The article mentions OpenAI seeking ways to \"monetize ChatGPT\" due to high demand and server strain. This indicates a primary driver for the subscription plan is OpenAI's need for revenue to sustain and improve the service.\n\n* **Independent Business Decisions:**  Both Microsoft and OpenAI are independent entities making their own business decisions. Microsoft's investments may benefit OpenAI, but it doesn't necessarily dictate OpenAI's pricing strategies.\n\n* **Market Trends:** Subscription models for AI services are becoming increasingly prevalent. OpenAI's decision could be influenced by broader market trends rather than solely by Microsoft's actions.\n\n#### C","label":"B","google\/gemma-2-27b-it_label":"C","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\n    Context:\n    Article A: Microsoft\\n plans to release software to help large companies create their own chatbots similar to ChatGPT, CNBC has learned.\\n\\nIn the two months since startup OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, it has become a hit, impressing people with its ability to spit out comments on a wide variety of topics and in many styles. UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been working to incorporate OpenAI technologies into its own products. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it is augmenting Bing, its search engine, and Edge, its internet browser, with ChatGPT-like technology.\\n\\nIn addition, Microsoft plans to announce technology for companies, schools and governments to create their own bots with ChatGPT, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be named while discussing private plans. Microsoft imagines helping clients launch new chatbots or refine their existing ones with the new technology, which could suggest responses for call-center agents to use during customer service conversations, the person said.\\n\\nThe underlying artificial intelligence model of ChatGPT cannot currently provide substantial answers about anything that happened after 2021, because it hasn\u2019t been trained on recent information. \n    Article B: OpenAI has launched its first subscription plan for ChatGPT, opening up the popular AI model for premium use just two months after its public launch.\\n\\nThe new plan, called ChatGPT Plus and announced in a company blog post on Wednesday, will charge subscribers $20 for monthly use of ChatGPT\u2019s tools. Users will get priority access to ChatGPT \u201cduring peak times,\u201d faster responses and \u201cpriority access to new features and improvements,\u201d the company wrote. The subscription is only available initially in the United States and will roll out to a waitlist first.\\n\\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement. The company also noted in its post that a waitlist is now available for an upcoming ChatGPT API.\\n\\nThe move comes just weeks after OpenAI president and chairman Greg Brockman posted to the company\u2019s official Discord server asking users for input on ways to \u201cmonetize ChatGPT.\u201d Some users (including this author) reported seeing an offer for a $42 per month pro tier in January, which promised early and priority access to new features and better reliability should the service, which has suffered repeated outages due to high demand in past weeks, again hit capacity.\\n\\nAfter OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late November, more than one million users overwhelmed the tool\u2019s site within five days, OpenAI has said. Since then, product releases and other announcements have flowed fast out of the San Francisco-based company led by CEO Sam Altman.\n\n    Event 1: Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is augmenting Bing and Edge with ChatGPT-like technology.\n    Event 2: OpenAI launches subscription plan for ChatGPT\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.
