Watching him begin to reshape content moderation and launch a poorly considered monetization scheme would be entertaining if their potential effects weren\u2019t so dire, with consequences for Twitter\u2019s employees and users, and potentially the broader society. \\n\\nOriginally reported Sunday by The Verge, a plan to charge verified users to get or keep their blue checks was expected to cost $20 a month. But after widespread backlash on the platform and a poll tweeted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, in which nearly 82% of users responded that they wouldn\u2019t pay anything for verification, those plans appear to have changed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Musk had posted a thread on the platform outlining his plan to charge $8 a month instead \u2014 part of an overhaul of Twitter\u2019s existing Blue service.\\n\\nAlong with the coveted blue check, Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to post longer video and audio clips. They will also have half as many ads in their feeds and be able to get around paywalls from news publishers \u201cwilling to work\u201d with the platform, and their tweets will get priority in replies, mentions and search results.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that such a plan could have a number of drawbacks.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion. Advertisers concerned about their brand have left the platform, leading to plummeting revenues for the company in recent months.\n\n    Event 1: A poll tweeted by Jason Calacanis showed that 82% of Twitter users wouldn\u2019t pay for verification.\n    Event 2: Twitter's value is half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

Wade on Friday. This decision will mean laws further restricting abortion care and services will go into effect in many states. Following May's leak of the draft Supreme Court opinion in which the justices appear ready to overturn Roe, we asked you what questions you had for our experts about abortion care and access in the U.S.\\n\\nMany of you wrote in wanting to know more about the impact this decision could have on hospitals, in vitro fertilization, and care for miscarriages. To answer those questions, we reached out to Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN and family planning doctor, who is also the board chair for Physicians for Reproductive Health, and NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin.\\n\\nMiscarriage care is definitely going to be impacted \u2014 it's already happening in Texas.\\n\\nA lot of times people think about miscarriage as something that's spontaneous, that somebody has no control over. That can be true, but it can also be something that people have to make decisions about. The standard of care for treating a miscarriage is the same as the standard of care for providing an abortion.\\n\\nThe way that can play out is if somebody has a miscarriage and they need to take medication to empty the uterus so they're not at risk of infection, that same medication is what's used for medication abortion. There have already been a lot of reports of pharmacists in Texas not filling those prescriptions for people who are suffering miscarriages.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nWhen the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion enshrined by Roe v. Wade last June, there were near-immediate consequences for women, children, and families: A 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion. Women were denied care while having miscarriages due in part to confusion among health providers. Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Miscarriage care already being impacted in Texas.\n    Event 2: 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

The deal\u2019s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter\u2019s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. It also averts a court battle that was set to take place if the acquisition did not close by 5 p.m. ET Friday. But Musk\u2019s takeover now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it. Musk on Thursday fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Neg Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to two sources familiar with the situation. He also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter\u2019s general counsel, a source told CNN.\\nDespite multiple news outlets confirming the changes Thursday night, Twitter staff had still not formally been informed of the changes as of Friday morning, two Twitter employees told CNN.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.
