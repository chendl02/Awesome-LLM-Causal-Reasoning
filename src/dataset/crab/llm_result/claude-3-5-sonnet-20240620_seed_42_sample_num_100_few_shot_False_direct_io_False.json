The economy softened as people started buying less to accommodate these higher prices. The cost of living jumped significantly, and people and businesses had to make cutbacks. Technology companies saw price increases for services, so companies had to evaluate and make cuts if necessary. \\n\\nHigher interest rates affect how much a company wants to borrow due to higher costs. These higher rates directly impact venture capitalists (VCs) and other funding of startups. Companies do not want to invest in riskier areas when the economy's future is uncertain. Economic uncertainties cause companies to reevaluate their hiring and growth strategies. \\n\\nInvestors want companies to decrease expenses as revenues slow down. VCs are worried that profits will be down this year after the large growth period. \\n\\nPart of the rise in layoffs is due to correcting the hiring of too many people. During the height of the pandemic, the use of technology grew significantly as everything moved online. \\n\\nWith the collapse of SVB, more venture capitalists and banks are going to be nervous about taking on the risk of start-up companies.\n    Article B: \\n\\nThe US, and the technology sector which were among its biggest customers, face another Lehman Brothers moment with the failure of SVB.\\n\\nUS regulators rushed to seize the assets of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on Friday after a run on the bank, the largest failure of a financial institution since the height of the financial crisis more than a decade ago.\\n\\nSilicon Valley, the country\\'s 16th largest bank, failed after depositors - mostly technology workers and venture capital-backed companies - hurried to withdraw their money this week as anxiety over the bank\u2019s situation spread.\\n\\nThe bank could no longer cope with the massive withdrawals of its customers and its last attempts to raise new money did not succeed.\\n\\nUS authorities therefore officially took possession of the bank and entrusted its management to the U.S. agency responsible for guaranteeing deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\\n\\nLittle known to the general public, SVB had specialised in financing start-ups and had become one of the largest banks in the US by asset size: at the end of 2022, it had $209 billion (\u20ac196 billion) in assets and about $175.4 billion (\u20ac164.5 billion) in deposits.\\n\\n\\nIts demise represents not only the largest bank failure since that of Washington Mutual in 2008, but also the second-largest failure of a retail bank in the United States.\\n\\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called several financial sector regulators together on Friday to discuss the situation, reminding them that she had \"full confidence\" in their ability to take appropriate action and that the banking sector remained \"resilient\".\n\n    Event 1: Higher interest rates affected how much companies wanted to borrow due to higher costs.\n    Event 2: The technology sector face crisis.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

They are also particularly dangerous for outdoor workers.\n\nThreat level: As of Monday morning, heat watches, advisories and warnings were in effect from the Carolinas to Texas, extending north into Wisconsin and Minnesota and south to the Gulf Coast.\n\n\n    Article B: \n\nHundreds more people were evacuated from their homes as wildfires blistered land in France, Spain and Portugal on Friday, while officials in Europe issued health warnings for the heatwave in the coming days.\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters, supported by water-bomber aircraft, have battled since Tuesday to control two blazes in southwestern France that have been fanned by scorching heat, tinder-box conditions and strong winds.\n\nWhile temperatures dipped a little in Portugal, they were still expected to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in some places, with five districts on red alert and more than 1,000 firefighters tackling 17 wildfires, authorities said.\n\nIn Spain, a new wildfire broke out in the south of the country after blazes in the west in the past week.\n\nMore than 400 people were evacuated from the hills of Mijas, a town popular with northern European tourists in the province of Malaga.

That data included consumers\u2019 names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers \u2014 all of which could lead to identity fraud and other financial crimes.\\n\\nThe data breach, announced six weeks after it was discovered, rattled the financial services industry, the cybersecurity sector and, most notably, the millions of consumers who were affected.

Security guards started to evacuate the cathedral even though they did not see any sign of a fire, a spokesman for the Paris fire brigade told CNN.\\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lochet, a 70-year-old worshiper, said the congregation had just begun the Universal Prayer when the siren sounded. He said visitors were ushered out but those gathered for mass remained in place. Lochet said mass continued until a police officer went up and told the priest: \u201cThis is no joke. You\u2019ve got to get out.\u201d\\nTwenty-three minutes later, at 6:43 p.m. (12:43 p.m. ET), a second alarm blared and the fire was visible at that point, the fire department said.\\nAround 400 firefighters were deployed to the scene but were delayed slightly by rush hour traffic.\\nPolice in Paris confirmed a fire had taken hold at Notre Dame and asked the public to avoid the area in a tweet sent at 7:20 p.m. (1:20 p.m. ET). A minute later, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo posted a tweet saying \u201ca terrible fire is underway\u201d with photographs taken outside the church: one of smoke billowing from near the spire and over the towers, and a second showing the fire department responders working at the scene.\\n\\nShortly before 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET), the cathedral\u2019s famed spire burned to a blackened shell before finally toppling, as thousands of Parisians who had gathered in the streets watched in horror. \n    Article B: \\nThe devastating fire that ravaged the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15 prompted unsubstantiated rumors online about who or what was to blame.\\n\\nBy Tuesday, for example, the website of former Fox News commentator Kevin Jackson had zeroed in on a whole group of people, running a headline that reads: \u201cMuslim Ties to Notre Dame Fire.\u201d\\n\\nWe could find no credible sources to support the incendiary suggestion that Muslims were responsible.\\n\\nThe French government said in a press release Tuesday the cause of the fire remained unknown, and Paris public prosecutor Remy Heitz told reporters that investigators were currently eyeing it as an accident.\\n\\nThe article on Jackson\u2019s site, however, advances the unsupported idea of a \u201cMuslim attack\u201d through paragraphs of innuendo, not fact.\\n\\n\u201cWas this a true accident? Or is someone trying to send Christians a message?\u201d the article on theblacksphere.net reads. \u201cMany people speculate this is a Muslim attack on Christianity. In 2016, a car parked outside Notre Dame was discovered. It contained full gas tanks and documents written in Arabic. Therefore, authorities were well-aware of the threats posed against Notre Dame.\u201d\\n\\nBut there is no evidence tying that 2016 episode with this week\u2019s fire, as some news outlets worked to make clear. The U.K.\u2019s Telegraph, which covered the 2016 incident at the time, affixed an update to its story indicating: \u201cThis story is from 2016 and unrelated to the fire at Notre-Dame on April 15 2019.\u201d\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Security guards started to evacuate the Notre Dame although there was no sign of a fire.\n    Event 2: Jackson's article published innuendo suggesting a \"Muslim attack\" was responsible.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Was it, as some argue, the result of Trump-era regulation rollbacks, risk mismanagement at the bank, sharp interest rate rises after a decade of ultra-low borrowing costs, or perhaps a combination of all three?\\n\\nFederal investigations have begun and lawsuits have been filed and no doubt new issues at the bank will emerge. But for now, here are the main reasons experts believed SVB failed.\\n\\nThe Vermont senator Bernie Sanders argues that the culprit was an \u201cabsurd\u201d 2018 law, supported by Congress and signed by Donald Trump, that undid some of the credit requirements imposed under the Dodd-Frank banking legislation brought in after the 2008 banking crisis.\\n\\nDodd-Frank required that banks with at least $50bn in assets \u2013 banks considered \u201csystemically important\u201d \u2013 undergo an annual Federal Reserve \u201cstress test\u201d and maintain certain levels of capital as well as plans for a living will if they failed.\\n\\nSVB\u2019s chief executive, Greg Becker, argued before Congress in 2015 that the $50bn threshold (SVB held $40bn at the time) was unnecessary and his bank, like other \u201cmid-sized\u201d or regional banks, \u201cdoes not present systemic risks\u201d.\\n\\nTrump said the new bill went a \u201clong way toward fixing\u201d Dodd-Frank, which he called a \u201cjob-killer\u201d. \n    Article B: Shares in banks all over the world have plummeted in recent days as fears that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) could precipitate a wider crisis in the sector.\\n\\nThe speed at which market jitters have spread across the world have forced bank executives and regulators to move with unprecedented swiftness: US authorities guaranteed all deposits in SVB \u2013 and smaller bank Signature \u2013 48 hours after it collapsed. Just hours after Credit Suisse\u2019s share price plunged on Wednesday, the Swiss central bank stepped in with a $54bn loan.\\n\\nWhile there\u2019s nothing new about a financial emergency, these crises \u2013 and their resulting responses \u2013 are unique in having been accelerated by a frenzy of social media chatter that has fuelled the panic.\\n\\n\u2018It was a bank sprint, not a bank run\u2019\\nA bank run occurs when customers lose faith in an institution\u2019s ability to look after their money, and large numbers withdraw their deposits all at once. As more people withdraw their funds, the likelihood of the bank being able to cover the withdrawals falls, leading more customers to pile in and demand the return of their money.\\n\\n\u201cIf you see a bomb disposal expert running down the street, don\u2019t ask them what\u2019s happened, just try to keep up,\u201d writes Daniel Davies, the managing director of Frontline Analysts, in the Financial Times.\\n\\nRumours around a bank\u2019s solvency can build up for months or years before it leads to a run. Or it can happen in a matter of hours.\n\n    Event 1: Interest rates rise after a decade of ultra-low borrowing costs.\n    Event 2: Shares in banks all over the world have plummeted.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Watching him begin to reshape content moderation and launch a poorly considered monetization scheme would be entertaining if their potential effects weren\u2019t so dire, with consequences for Twitter\u2019s employees and users, and potentially the broader society. \\n\\nOriginally reported Sunday by The Verge, a plan to charge verified users to get or keep their blue checks was expected to cost $20 a month. But after widespread backlash on the platform and a poll tweeted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, in which nearly 82% of users responded that they wouldn\u2019t pay anything for verification, those plans appear to have changed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Musk had posted a thread on the platform outlining his plan to charge $8 a month instead \u2014 part of an overhaul of Twitter\u2019s existing Blue service.\\n\\nAlong with the coveted blue check, Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to post longer video and audio clips. They will also have half as many ads in their feeds and be able to get around paywalls from news publishers \u201cwilling to work\u201d with the platform, and their tweets will get priority in replies, mentions and search results.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that such a plan could have a number of drawbacks.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion. Advertisers concerned about their brand have left the platform, leading to plummeting revenues for the company in recent months.\n\n    Event 1: A poll tweeted by Jason Calacanis showed that 82% of Twitter users wouldn\u2019t pay for verification.\n    Event 2: Twitter's value is half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

On the other hand, ETH corrected for 336 days, losing 94% of its value. Therefore, while the ETH correction was sharper and lasted for a shorter period of time, there was not a pronounced difference between the two.\\n\\nFollowing this, BTC increased by 330% in 191 days, while ETH moved upwards by 290% in 197 days. This somewhat made up for the difference from the sharper ETH fall preceding this upward movement.\\n\\nFinally, BTC decreased by 71.50% in 261 days leading up to the March 2020 bottom, while ETH decreased by 66.50% in 259 days, with very similar rates of decrease.\\n\\nUnlike the 2017-2020 period, there is a significant difference in the movement of both assets in 2021.\\n\\nMeasuring from the March 2020 bottom, BTC increased by 1,520% in 398 days.

It was last up more than 12% and near the highs of the day.\\n\\nMusk also repeated his support for cryptocurrency in general, despite potential environmental risks, saying, \u201cOne thing you do need to watch out for with crypto, especially bitcoin, using proof of work, using energy that\u2019s a bit too much and not necessarily good for the environment.\u201d\\n\\nAs bitcoin mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy, Musk said, Tesla will likely move to accept bitcoin for transactions once again.\\n\\nMusk also said that at this time, the only publicly traded stock he owns is Tesla\u2019s, and that he personally owns some bitcoin, dogecoin and ethereum. \u201cThe only significant thing I own outside of Tesla is SpaceX,\u201d he noted, having helped create both companies.\\n\\nHe also said he has been holding his bitcoin long term.\\n\\n\u201cIf the price of bitcoin goes down I lose money. I might pump but I don\u2019t dump,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI definitely do not believe in getting the price high and selling or anything like that.

The economy softened as people started buying less to accommodate these higher prices. The cost of living jumped significantly, and people and businesses had to make cutbacks. Technology companies saw price increases for services, so companies had to evaluate and make cuts if necessary. \\n\\nHigher interest rates affect how much a company wants to borrow due to higher costs. These higher rates directly impact venture capitalists (VCs) and other funding of startups. Companies do not want to invest in riskier areas when the economy's future is uncertain. Economic uncertainties cause companies to reevaluate their hiring and growth strategies. \\n\\nInvestors want companies to decrease expenses as revenues slow down. VCs are worried that profits will be down this year after the large growth period. \\n\\nPart of the rise in layoffs is due to correcting the hiring of too many people.

UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been working to incorporate OpenAI technologies into its own products. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it is augmenting Bing, its search engine, and Edge, its internet browser, with ChatGPT-like technology.\\n\\nIn addition, Microsoft plans to announce technology for companies, schools and governments to create their own bots with ChatGPT, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be named while discussing private plans. Microsoft imagines helping clients launch new chatbots or refine their existing ones with the new technology, which could suggest responses for call-center agents to use during customer service conversations, the person said.\\n\\nThe underlying artificial intelligence model of ChatGPT cannot currently provide substantial answers about anything that happened after 2021, because it hasn\u2019t been trained on recent information. \n    Article B: Billionaire Twitter owner Elon Musk is again sounding warning bells on the dangers of artificial intelligence to humanity \u2014 and claiming that a popular chatbot has a liberal bias that he plans to counter with his own AI creation.\\n\\nMusk told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a segment aired Monday night that he plans to create an alternative to the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT that he is calling \u201cTruthGPT,\u201d which will be a \u201cmaximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe.\u201d\\n\\nThe idea, Musk said, is that an AI that wants to understand humanity is less likely to destroy it.\\n\\nMusk also said he\u2019s worried that ChatGPT \u201cis being trained to be politically correct.\u201d\\n\\nIn the first of a two-part interview with Carlson, Musk also advocated for the regulation of artificial intelligence, saying he\u2019s a \u201cbig fan.\u201d He called AI \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than cars or rockets and said it has the potential to destroy humanity.\\n\\neparately, Musk has incorporated a new business called X.AI Corp,, according to a Nevada business filing. The website of the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s office says the business was formed on March 9 and lists Musk as its director and his longtime adviser, Jared Birchall, as secretary.\\n\\nMusk has for many years expressed strong opinions about artificial intelligence and has dismissed other tech leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, for having what he has described as a \u201climited\u201d understanding of the field.\n\n    Event 1: Microsoft plans to release software to help large companies create their own chatbots similar to ChatGPT.\n    Event 2: Musk is advocating for the regulation of artificial intelligence and believes it has the potential to destroy humanity.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Sweden leads the 27 EU countries with its 63% renewable energy share, while in Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Ireland, renewable sources make up less than 13% of total energy use.\\n\\nA rapid shift to renewable energy is crucial if the EU is to meet its climate change goals, including a legally binding aim to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.\\n\\nEU countries will have to raise to 29% the share of renewables in energy used by the transport sector.

Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Trump appointed three conservative judges to the court - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 solidifying a conservative majority.\n    Event 2: 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Miscarriage care already being impacted in Texas.\n    Event 2: 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

The confirmation comes after a source familiar with the deal told CNN the deal had closed Thursday night.\\n\\nMusk also appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, \u201cthe bird is freed.\u201d. The deal\u2019s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter\u2019s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. It also averts a court battle that was set to take place if the acquisition did not close by 5 p.m. ET Friday. But Musk\u2019s takeover now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it. Musk on Thursday fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Neg Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to two sources familiar with the situation. He also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter\u2019s general counsel, a source told CNN.\\nDespite multiple news outlets confirming the changes Thursday night, Twitter staff had still not formally been informed of the changes as of Friday morning, two Twitter employees told CNN.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

The records were obtained from an anonymous source by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ then shared them with a large network of international partners, including the Guardian and the BBC.\\n\\nWhat do they reveal?\\nThe documents show the myriad ways in which the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. Twelve national leaders are among 143 politicians, their families and close associates from around the world known to have been using offshore tax havens.\\n\\nA $2bn trail leads all the way to Vladimir Putin. The Russian president\u2019s best friend \u2013 a cellist called Sergei Roldugin \u2013 is at the centre of a scheme in which money from Russian state banks is hidden offshore.

So when Iceland\\'s financial sector collapsed in 2008, Wintris became a creditor to those banks. In 2013, Gunnlaugsson became the prime minister, having run partly on a promise to get tougher with Iceland\\'s remaining foreign creditors.\\n\\nSo what Icelandic voters didn\\'t know when they elected him in 2013, but have learned with this week\\'s \"Panama Papers\" revelations, is that Gunnlaugsson\\'s own wife was secretly one of the creditors he\\'d promised to crack down on \u2014 an enormous and undisclosed conflict of interest.\\n\\nWhen the truth came out this week, it led to mass protests on Monday calling for Gunnlaugsson\\'s resignation.

Wade on Friday, declaring that the constitutional right to abortion, upheld for nearly a half century, no longer exists.\\n\\nWriting for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1973 Roe ruling and repeated subsequent high court decisions reaffirming Roe \"must be overruled\" because they were \"egregiously wrong,\" the arguments \"exceptionally weak\" and so \"damaging\" that they amounted to \"an abuse of judicial authority.\"\\n\\nThe decision, most of which was leaked in early May, means that abortion rights will be rolled back in nearly half of the states immediately, with more restrictions likely to follow. For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country. The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter.\\n\\nJoining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks. Calling the decision \"a serious jolt to the legal system,\" he said that both the majority and dissent displayed \"a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share.\"\n    Article B: \\n\\nIn the summer of 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden faced allegations of hypocrisy and \"flip-flopping\" after he strongly condemned the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access.\\n\\nSpeaking on June 24, Biden described Roe as \"the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy,\" and he called the decision to overturn it a \"tragic error\" and the \"realization of an extreme ideology.\"\\n\\nHowever, many observers \u2014 both to the left and right of Biden on the ideological spectrum \u2014 contrasted such remarks, in 2022, with what they presented as Biden\\'s very different stance on the abortion rights landmark, four decades ago.\\n\\nOn June 24, one Facebook user published a viral post which contained a screenshot of an article by the London Independent, with the headline \"Biden voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 1982...\" and the caption \"Wonder how those protesting the Supreme Court decision feel about this. Chances are they are the same people that voted for Biden.\"\\n\\nIn recent years, the same core claim \u2014 that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress \u2014 has featured in news articles by the The New York Times, Fox News, and the New York Post.\\n\\nThat claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is \"True.\"\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: June 24, 2022: Supreme Court rules 6-3 to uphold Mississippi's law, with the decision to overturn Roe a 5-4 vote.\n    Event 2: A viral Facebook post claimed that Biden voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 1982.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

The company says this update is another milestone in the advancement of AI. The new technology has the potential to improve how people learn new languages, how blind people process images, and even how we do our taxes.\\n\\nOpenAI also claims that the new model supports a chatbot that\u2019s more factual, creative, concise, and can understand images, instead of just text.\\n\\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, called GPT-4 \u201cour most capable and aligned model yet.\u201d He also cautioned that \u201cit is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it\u201d\n    Article B: OpenAI has launched its first subscription plan for ChatGPT, opening up the popular AI model for premium use just two months after its public launch.\\n\\nThe new plan, called ChatGPT Plus and announced in a company blog post on Wednesday, will charge subscribers $20 for monthly use of ChatGPT\u2019s tools.

The subscription is only available initially in the United States and will roll out to a waitlist first.\\n\\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement. The company also noted in its post that a waitlist is now available for an upcoming ChatGPT API.\\n\\nThe move comes just weeks after OpenAI president and chairman Greg Brockman posted to the company\u2019s official Discord server asking users for input on ways to \u201cmonetize ChatGPT.\u201d Some users (including this author) reported seeing an offer for a $42 per month pro tier in January, which promised early and priority access to new features and better reliability should the service, which has suffered repeated outages due to high demand in past weeks, again hit capacity.\\n\\nAfter OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late November, more than one million users overwhelmed the tool\u2019s site within five days, OpenAI has said.

According to the agency, there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil so far this year \u2014 most of which erupted in the Amazon. That represents an astonishing leap of more than 80% over last year and by far the most that the agency has recorded since it began compiling this data in 2013.\\n\\nAbout half those fires, or nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018. Smoke from the fires has darkened the skies over major Brazilian cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo.\\n\\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has signaled unconcern about the situation. The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding. That includes INPE itself, whose leader, Ricardo Magnus Os\u00f3rio Galv\u00e3o, was canned this month because \u2014 according to Galv\u00e3o \u2014 he questioned how Bolsonaro was using his agency's data.\\n\\nAsked about the fires by local media, Bolsonaro baselessly suggested that nongovernmental organizations have been setting the fires themselves as retaliation for the scaling back of Brazil's usual funding support for them. \n    Article B: \\n\\nInternational pressure may be the only way to stop the Brazilian government from taking a \u201csuicide\u201d path in the Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most respected scientists has said, as the world\u2019s biggest rainforest continues to be ravaged by thousands of deliberate fires.\\n\\nThe large number of conflagrations \u2013 set illegally to clear and prepare land for crops, cattle and property speculation \u2013 has prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency, created giant smoke clouds that have drifted hundreds of miles, and sparked international concerns about the destruction of an essential carbon sink.\\n\\n\u201cOur house is burning,\u201d tweeted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who called for emergency talks on the subject at this week\u2019s G7 summit. But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d. Asked about the fires, he declined to comment but reportedly said Bolsonaro\u2019s government had \u201clegitimate ambitions to bring prosperity to its people\u201d.\\n\\nScientists say the ongoing destruction will have dire consequences for Brazil and the world.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: The Brazilian President has scaled back environmental regulations and funding for environmental agencies.\n    Event 2: The EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

That has pushed European governments into a desperate scramble for new supplies and for ways to blunt the impact as economic growth slows and household utility bills rise.\\n\\nThe crisis deepened when Russia\u2019s state-owned exporter Gazprom said the main pipeline carrying gas to Germany would stay closed, blaming an oil leak and claiming the problems could not be fixed because of sanctions barring many dealings with Russia.\\n\\nEuropean officials say it\u2019s energy blackmail, aimed at pressuring and dividing the European Union as it supports Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion.\\n\\nHere is the latest on Europe\u2019s efforts to avoid an energy disaster:\\n\\nJust about. The halt in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline means Russian gas shipments have fallen 89% from a year ago. Russia used to supply 40% of Europe\u2019s natural gas, and even more to Germany, where inexpensive energy was a pillar of the economy.\\n\\nThere\u2019s still some Russian gas flowing to Europe through a pipeline passing through Ukraine into Slovakia, and another crossing the Black Sea to Turkey and then to EU member Bulgaria. Russia started cutting back gas as early as last summer, before the war in Ukraine started. That sent gas prices sharply higher.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister is reportedly preparing to commit as much as \u00a3150 billion ($172 billion) to shield households and businesses from soaring energy bills, increasing government borrowing at a time when investors are already on edge about the country\u2019s finances.\\n\\nLiz Truss, who earlier this week succeeded Boris Johnson, told lawmakers Wednesday that she would unveil her plans to tackle sky-high energy prices on Thursday.\\n\\nTruss is drawing up plans to freeze the average annual energy bill for households at around \u00a32,500 ($2,860) for the next two years, the Financial Times reported. That would mean bills rising by 27% from their current level, but keep them well below the \u00a33,549 ($3,954) they would hit starting in October without government intervention.\\n\\nIt will be expensive. The FT reported that the plan could include \u00a390 billion ($103 billion) in support to households, and up to \u00a360 billion ($69 billion) for businesses, the FT said.\\n\\nIf so, that would outstrip the amount the government spent subsidizing the salaries of millions of workers during the pandemic to prevent mass layoffs by a whopping \u00a380 billion ($91 billion). It would also dwarf the \u20ac95 billion ($94 billion) the German government has promised so far this year to help its households and businesses meet their energy costs.\\n\\nLike the rest of Europe, the United Kingdom is grappling with how to pay for its ambitious relief package.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Russia's state-owned exporter Gazprom has closed the main pipeline carrying gas to Germany.\n    Event 2: Governments to spend billions to protect businesses and consumers from soaring bills\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Meanwhile, First Republic bank received a $30 billion lifeline on Thursday from some of the largest banks in the United States.\\n\\nStill, First Republic\u2019s lifeline might not be enough to keep it afloat.

There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion. Advertisers concerned about their brand have left the platform, leading to plummeting revenues for the company in recent months.\n    Article B: Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter, has reportedly issued stock grants to the company\\'s staff at a valuation of close to $20 billion.\\n\\nThe price is only half of what he paid for Twitter in October 2022, when he shelled out $44 billion to buy the microblogging platform, according to multiple media sources on Saturday.\\n\\n\"Musk sent Twitter employees an email about the state of Twitter 2.0.

I asked the buzzy artificial intelligence chatbot, which has ignited conversation in schools, corporate boardrooms and social media, to explain itself.\\n\\nIn its own description, ChatGPT is \u201can AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model. It uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to text inputs in a conversational manner.\u201d\\n\\nThe tool is the talk of the business world. It has been mentioned on earnings calls by management from a range of companies including oil giants, banks \u2014 and even the industrial behemoth Caterpillar.\\n\\nIt has also sparked concerns over potential abuses. In classrooms, students have used ChatGPT to generate entire essays, while hackers have begun testing it to write malicious code.\\n\\nSo what is ChatGPT, exactly? Here\u2019s a simple guide on all you need to know about the popular AI chatbot.\\n\\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by San Francisco-based startup OpenAI. OpenAI was co-founded in 2015 by Elon Musk and Sam Altman and is backed by well-known investors \u2014 most notably Microsoft. \\n\\nIt is one of several examples of generative AI. These are tools that allow users to enter written prompts and receive new human-like text or images and videos generated by the AI.\\n\\nPrior examples include Dall-E, a text-to-image program from OpenAI that garnered attention from people captivated by its ability to come up with realistic, often absurd, pictures that match people\u2019s text descriptions.\n    Article B: Microsoft\\n plans to release software to help large companies create their own chatbots similar to ChatGPT, CNBC has learned.\\n\\nIn the two months since startup OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, it has become a hit, impressing people with its ability to spit out comments on a wide variety of topics and in many styles. UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been working to incorporate OpenAI technologies into its own products. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it is augmenting Bing, its search engine, and Edge, its internet browser, with ChatGPT-like technology.\\n\\nIn addition, Microsoft plans to announce technology for companies, schools and governments to create their own bots with ChatGPT, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be named while discussing private plans. Microsoft imagines helping clients launch new chatbots or refine their existing ones with the new technology, which could suggest responses for call-center agents to use during customer service conversations, the person said.\\n\\nThe underlying artificial intelligence model of ChatGPT cannot currently provide substantial answers about anything that happened after 2021, because it hasn\u2019t been trained on recent information. \n\n    Event 1: It has sparked concerns over potential abuses, such as students using it to generate entire essays and hackers testing it to write malicious code.\n    Event 2: Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is augmenting Bing and Edge with ChatGPT-like technology.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

Amini died on Sept. 16 three days after her arrest in Tehran, and many Iranians are alleging that she was killed by law enforcement. Protestors have faced a brutal crackdown from the government who have deployed riot police, resulting in arrests, injuries and at least 17 deaths, according to the state media.\\n\\nIranian authorities claim that Amini died of heart failure, but her family and protestors across Iran accuse the government of covering up her murder. The international protests have expanded to express anger over a range of issues, not just restrictions women face over hijabs and more generally in Iran but also against the current regime. At one Iranian protest, a street full of Iranians chanted \u201cdeath to the oppressor, be it the shah or the supreme leader!\u201d\\n\\nMahsa Amini, 22, was arrested on Sept. 13 while visiting Tehran by the notorious morality police who enforce compulsory conservative Islamic behavior and dress.

Amini was accused of violating the country\u2019s law on headscarves.\\n\\nIran\u2019s security forces said that upon her arrest, Amini was taken to a detention center where she received training on hijab rules, and it was there that she collapsed from a heart attack.\n    Article B: \\n\\nNearly five months after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, died in the custody of the country\u2019s \u201cmorality police\u201d after being arrested for allegedly wearing her hijab \u201cimproperly,\u201d sparking outrage and nationwide demonstrations, Iranian state news media reports the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has approved a proposal to \u201cpardon or commute\u201d sentences for tens of thousands of prisoners as part of an annual amnesty. The decree is a rare acknowledgment from the government of the sheer volume of people it has detained, but it comes with conditions that will likely exclude protesters, CNN reports.\\n\\nDespite talks of amnesty, Iranian authorities continue to crack down on demonstrators with lethal violence. As of January, the government has executed at least four prisoners over crimes it claims they committed during the demonstrations, underlining the speed at which Iranian authorities are carrying out the death sentences of detainees. News of the executions, which included a public hanging, arrived shortly after a senior Iranian official suggested the morality police had been \u201cabolished by the same authorities who installed it,\u201d which the Iranian government neither confirmed nor denied. For weeks, videos have shown police beating protesters \u2014 many of whom are women and teenagers \u2014 with batons and spraying tear gas and bullets into crowds.

This represents the single largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936.\\n\\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to cleaner energy provides rural communities with an affordable and reliable power grid, while supporting thousands of new jobs and helping lower energy costs in the future,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. \u201cThese investments will also combat climate change and significantly reduce air and water pollution that put children\u2019s health at risk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stands ready to partner with municipalities, tribal entities, entrepreneurs, rural electric cooperatives and other utilities to see this transformative investment come to life and create new economic growth and healthier communities.\u201d\\n\\nFunding is available through two programs under President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which makes the nation\u2019s largest-ever investment in combatting the climate crisis. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be opening a Letter of Interest process for the Empowering Rural America (\u201cNew ERA\u201d) program, which makes $9.7 billion available to eligible rural electric cooperatives to deploy renewable energy systems, zero-emission and carbon capture systems.\n    Article B: \\n\\nToday, EPA issued a multi-part proposal that will build on the strong foundation for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program started in the Biden-Harris Administration and seeks to advance the priorities of energy security, less pollution, and consumer protection. The RFS \u201cSet\u201d proposal requests public input on required volumes of biofuel for the next one to three years and on a series of important modifications to strengthen and expand the program. The agency is seeking public input on the proposal to help shape the RFS program in the years ahead.\\n\\n\u201cThe Renewable Fuel Standard program is critical to helping incorporate more homegrown biofuels into the market,\u201d said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. \u201cThis proposal supports low-carbon renewable fuels and seeks public input on ways to strengthen the program. With this proposal, EPA seeks to provide consumers with more options while diversifying our nation\u2019s energy mix. EPA is also focused on strengthening the economics of our critical energy infrastructure, needed to maintain and boost our energy security. We\u2019re eager to continue the dialogue on how biofuels can bolster U.S. energy security, protect consumers from high fuel costs, strengthen the rural economy, and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\\n\\nThis proposal includes steady growth of biofuels for use in the nation\u2019s fuel supply for 2023, 2024, and 2025.

In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, Biden alluded to the protests over her death and said the US stood with the \u201cbrave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.\u201d\\n\\nDays later, the US announced sanctions on Iran\u2019s morality police \u201cfor abuse and violence against Iranian women and the violation of the rights of peaceful Iranian protestors.\u201d\\n\\nThe effort to move quickly to respond to the protests sweeping Iran comes after some top officials in the Biden administration acknowledged that the US was too slow to respond when protests erupted in Iran in 2009.

Protestors have faced a brutal crackdown from the government who have deployed riot police, resulting in arrests, injuries and at least 17 deaths, according to the state media.\\n\\nIranian authorities claim that Amini died of heart failure, but her family and protestors across Iran accuse the government of covering up her murder. The international protests have expanded to express anger over a range of issues, not just restrictions women face over hijabs and more generally in Iran but also against the current regime. At one Iranian protest, a street full of Iranians chanted \u201cdeath to the oppressor, be it the shah or the supreme leader!\u201d\\n\\nMahsa Amini, 22, was arrested on Sept. 13 while visiting Tehran by the notorious morality police who enforce compulsory conservative Islamic behavior and dress. Hijabs are mandatory to wear in public for all women in Iran, regardless of religion or nationality. Amini was accused of violating the country\u2019s law on headscarves.\\n\\nIran\u2019s security forces said that upon her arrest, Amini was taken to a detention center where she received training on hijab rules, and it was there that she collapsed from a heart attack.\n\n    Event 1: Joe Biden expresses his support behind the demonstrators.\n    Event 2: International protests have expanded to express anger over the situation in Iran.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

The biggest tremors have been felt in the markets for natural gas, coal and electricity \u2013 with significant turmoil in oil markets as well, necessitating two oil stock releases of unparalleled scale by IEA member countries to avoid even more severe disruptions. With unrelenting geopolitical and economic concerns, energy markets remain extremely vulnerable, and the crisis is a reminder of the fragility and unsustainability of the current global energy system, the World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) warns.\\n\\nThe WEO\u2019s analysis finds scant evidence to support claims from some quarters that climate policies and net zero commitments contributed to the run-up in energy prices. In the most affected regions, higher shares of renewables were correlated with lower electricity prices \u2013 and more efficient homes and electrified heat have provided an important buffer for some consumers, albeit far from enough.

That would mean bills rising by 27% from their current level, but keep them well below the \u00a33,549 ($3,954) they would hit starting in October without government intervention.\\n\\nIt will be expensive. The FT reported that the plan could include \u00a390 billion ($103 billion) in support to households, and up to \u00a360 billion ($69 billion) for businesses, the FT said.\\n\\nIf so, that would outstrip the amount the government spent subsidizing the salaries of millions of workers during the pandemic to prevent mass layoffs by a whopping \u00a380 billion ($91 billion).

The FDIC in turn has created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara, which now holds the insured deposits from SVB.\\n\\nThe FDIC said in the announcement that insured depositors will have access to their deposits no later than Monday morning.

The regulator said it will pay uninsured depositors an advanced dividend within the next week, with potential additional dividend payments as the regulator sells SVB\u2019s assets.\\n\\nWhether depositors with more than $250,000 ultimately get all their money back will be determined by the amount of money the regulator gets as it sells Silicon Valley assets or if another bank takes ownership of the remaining assets. \n\n    Event 1: California collected less in taxes in September marking the third straight month of revenues coming in below projections.\n    Event 2: Companies and wealthy individuals left largely unsure of what will happen to their money.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

The government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who promised to relax environmental protections, faces growing criticism in Brazil and abroad as the Amazon burns.

But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d.

The powerful rebound move reflected a spike in the capital flow from the spot ETH to spot BTC market. That also led analysts at Delphi Digital, an independent market research firm, to highlight Ether\\'s \"formidable strength\" in the Bitcoin-quoted markets. They wrote:\\n\\n\"If you look at the YTD ETH\/BTC chart in isolation, you probably wouldn\u2019t guess fear in the crypto market is the highest it\u2019s been in a year.\"\\nBut a closer look into the ETH\/BTC chart returns evidence that bullish traders might be heading into a bull trap.\\n\\nETH\/BTC formed a pattern that began wide at the bottom and contracted as the price moved higher. As a result, the trading range narrowed. Meanwhile, the volumes declined as the prices rose and the contracting pattern evolved.\\n\\nClassic chartists refer to the structure as a rising wedge. They interpret it as a traditional bearish reversal pattern, primarily because of the loss of the upside momentum on each successive high formation.\\n\\nRising wedges mature as the asset reaches the level where its two trendlines converge. Nevertheless, bearish confirmations do not come until the price breaks below the wedge support in a convincing fashion.\n    Article B: \\n\\nEthereum\u2019s much-hyped and somewhat controversial \u201cLondon\u201d hard fork has just activated.\\n\\nSo far, news of the successful upgrade has coincided with a runup in the price of ether, the native token of ethereum\u2019s blockchain. The cryptocurrency is at $2,620, up 3.9% in the last 24 hours.\\n\\nA big part of the enthusiasm has to do with the fact that the software upgrade means a few big \u2014 and necessary \u2014 changes are coming to the code underpinning the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency. \\n\\nIt has always been a tough go for ethereum users. The blockchain has a long-standing problem with scaling, and its highly unpredictable and sometimes exorbitant transaction fees can annoy even its biggest fans.\\n\\nThe problem has become worse in recent months thanks to a surge in interest in nonfungible tokens, which are mostly built on ethereum\u2019s blockchain, as well as an explosive growth in the world of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which also largely uses the ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nThursday\u2019s changes to the code, which has little to do with the city of London, are designed to fix many of these issues by destroying or \u201cburning\u201d ether coins and changing the way transaction fees work so that they are more predictable. \\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: The volumes declined as the prices rose.\n    Event 2: The software upgrade behind Ethereum brings necessary changes to the code underpinning the cryptocurrency.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

That has pushed European governments into a desperate scramble for new supplies and for ways to blunt the impact as economic growth slows and household utility bills rise.\\n\\nThe crisis deepened when Russia\u2019s state-owned exporter Gazprom said the main pipeline carrying gas to Germany would stay closed, blaming an oil leak and claiming the problems could not be fixed because of sanctions barring many dealings with Russia.\\n\\nEuropean officials say it\u2019s energy blackmail, aimed at pressuring and dividing the European Union as it supports Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion.\\n\\nHere is the latest on Europe\u2019s efforts to avoid an energy disaster:\\n\\nJust about. The halt in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline means Russian gas shipments have fallen 89% from a year ago. Russia used to supply 40% of Europe\u2019s natural gas, and even more to Germany, where inexpensive energy was a pillar of the economy.\\n\\nThere\u2019s still some Russian gas flowing to Europe through a pipeline passing through Ukraine into Slovakia, and another crossing the Black Sea to Turkey and then to EU member Bulgaria. Russia started cutting back gas as early as last summer, before the war in Ukraine started. That sent gas prices sharply higher.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister is reportedly preparing to commit as much as \u00a3150 billion ($172 billion) to shield households and businesses from soaring energy bills, increasing government borrowing at a time when investors are already on edge about the country\u2019s finances.\\n\\nLiz Truss, who earlier this week succeeded Boris Johnson, told lawmakers Wednesday that she would unveil her plans to tackle sky-high energy prices on Thursday.\\n\\nTruss is drawing up plans to freeze the average annual energy bill for households at around \u00a32,500 ($2,860) for the next two years, the Financial Times reported. That would mean bills rising by 27% from their current level, but keep them well below the \u00a33,549 ($3,954) they would hit starting in October without government intervention.\\n\\nIt will be expensive. The FT reported that the plan could include \u00a390 billion ($103 billion) in support to households, and up to \u00a360 billion ($69 billion) for businesses, the FT said.\\n\\nIf so, that would outstrip the amount the government spent subsidizing the salaries of millions of workers during the pandemic to prevent mass layoffs by a whopping \u00a380 billion ($91 billion).

Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access.\\n\\nSpeaking on June 24, Biden described Roe as \"the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy,\" and he called the decision to overturn it a \"tragic error\" and the \"realization of an extreme ideology.\"\\n\\nHowever, many observers \u2014 both to the left and right of Biden on the ideological spectrum \u2014 contrasted such remarks, in 2022, with what they presented as Biden\\'s very different stance on the abortion rights landmark, four decades ago.\\n\\nOn June 24, one Facebook user published a viral post which contained a screenshot of an article by the London Independent, with the headline \"Biden voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 1982...\" and the caption \"Wonder how those protesting the Supreme Court decision feel about this. Chances are they are the same people that voted for Biden.\"\\n\\nIn recent years, the same core claim \u2014 that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress \u2014 has featured in news articles by the The New York Times, Fox News, and the New York Post.\\n\\nThat claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is \"True.\"\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nIn a historic and far-reaching decision, the U.S. Supreme Court officially reversed Roe v. Wade on Friday, declaring that the constitutional right to abortion, upheld for nearly a half century, no longer exists.\\n\\nWriting for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1973 Roe ruling and repeated subsequent high court decisions reaffirming Roe \"must be overruled\" because they were \"egregiously wrong,\" the arguments \"exceptionally weak\" and so \"damaging\" that they amounted to \"an abuse of judicial authority.\"\\n\\nThe decision, most of which was leaked in early May, means that abortion rights will be rolled back in nearly half of the states immediately, with more restrictions likely to follow. For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country. The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter.\\n\\nJoining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks. Calling the decision \"a serious jolt to the legal system,\" he said that both the majority and dissent displayed \"a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share.\"\n\n    Event 1: Biden did vote in favor of effectively overturning Roe in 1982, but voted against an identical proposal one year later.\n    Event 2: June 24, 2022: Supreme Court rules 6-3 to uphold Mississippi's law, with the decision to overturn Roe a 5-4 vote.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.

I don\\'t think there\\'s any evidence to support that,\" analyst Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue told AFP.\\n\\nIn their most recent election cycles, Latin American countries have resoundingly dethroned incumbent parties on the right and center-right of the political spectrum.\\n\\nHonduras, Bolivia and Argentina are among those to have turned their backs on the right, while Colombia in June elected its first leftist president despite a deep-rooted mistrust, as elsewhere in the region, of anything with perceived links to \"communism.\"\\n\\nMany voters were jolted leftward by economic troubles and the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nVoters across the globe felt ignored, even denigrated, by the political establishment as poverty and inequality deepened.\\n\\n\"It is more of a rejectionist trend than anything else... people looking for an alternative,\" said Shifter of the recent string of leftist victories.\\n\\n\"It just so happens that we are in that moment in Latin America where a lot of the governments that are being rejected are of the right or the center right.\"\n    Article B: \\n\\nDramatic elections in Brazil, Chile and Colombia brought leftist governments into power across much of Latin America in 2022, capping the region\\'s second \"pink tide\" in two decades.\\n\\n However, their struggles amid stubborn economic headwinds suggest the wave may have crested. An anti-incumbent streak that lifted the left could soon swing major elections the other way.\\n\\nTo have the same staying power as the left-wing renaissance at the turn of the century, governments will need to reignite economies that have frustrated voters and investors alike during a decade of mostly mediocre growth.\\n\\nChilean President Gabriel Boric, 36, took office in March as his country\\'s most progressive leader in half a century and its youngest ever. But setbacks including the rejection of a new constitution have dented his popularity and forced concessions to the center, including swapping some of the youthful cohort in his cabinet for more experienced establishment figures.\\n\\nColombia also swung sharply to the left with June\\'s election of Gustavo Petro, a 62-year-old former guerrilla vowing to tackle inequality with tax and land reforms. He has shored up fiscal concerns with the former, but spooked investors with a proposed ban on new oil and gas exploration and second-guessing of central bank policy.\\n\\nBrazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 77, who narrowly beat incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in October, is a holdover from the region\\'s first pink tide, when a commodity boom helped him finish his 2003-2010 presidency with record approval.\\n\\nHowever, corruption scandals and economic mismanagement under his chosen successor tarred Lula\\'s legacy.\n\n    Event 1: A \"pink tide\" of left-leaning governments swept Latin America in the early 2000s.\n    Event 2: Colombia elects Gustavo Petro, a 62-year-old former guerrilla.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Begin your response with reasoning or evidence to suport your explanation, then return me the final result marked by '####'.
