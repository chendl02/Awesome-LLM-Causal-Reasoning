Watching him begin to reshape content moderation and launch a poorly considered monetization scheme would be entertaining if their potential effects weren\u2019t so dire, with consequences for Twitter\u2019s employees and users, and potentially the broader society. \\n\\nOriginally reported Sunday by The Verge, a plan to charge verified users to get or keep their blue checks was expected to cost $20 a month. But after widespread backlash on the platform and a poll tweeted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, in which nearly 82% of users responded that they wouldn\u2019t pay anything for verification, those plans appear to have changed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Musk had posted a thread on the platform outlining his plan to charge $8 a month instead \u2014 part of an overhaul of Twitter\u2019s existing Blue service.\\n\\nAlong with the coveted blue check, Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to post longer video and audio clips. They will also have half as many ads in their feeds and be able to get around paywalls from news publishers \u201cwilling to work\u201d with the platform, and their tweets will get priority in replies, mentions and search results.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that such a plan could have a number of drawbacks.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion. Advertisers concerned about their brand have left the platform, leading to plummeting revenues for the company in recent months.\n\n    Event 1: A poll tweeted by Jason Calacanis showed that 82% of Twitter users wouldn\u2019t pay for verification.\n    Event 2: Twitter's value is half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

These are two separate events in different contexts, and the text suggests that the 10-year-old's situation was the result of a change in reproductive rights laws that allowed state-by-state restriction, similar to the implication in Article A about Texas's restriction on abortion care affecting miscarriage treatment.

Wade on Friday. This decision will mean laws further restricting abortion care and services will go into effect in many states. Following May's leak of the draft Supreme Court opinion in which the justices appear ready to overturn Roe, we asked you what questions you had for our experts about abortion care and access in the U.S.\\n\\nMany of you wrote in wanting to know more about the impact this decision could have on hospitals, in vitro fertilization, and care for miscarriages. To answer those questions, we reached out to Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN and family planning doctor, who is also the board chair for Physicians for Reproductive Health, and NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin.\\n\\nMiscarriage care is definitely going to be impacted \u2014 it's already happening in Texas.\\n\\nA lot of times people think about miscarriage as something that's spontaneous, that somebody has no control over. That can be true, but it can also be something that people have to make decisions about. The standard of care for treating a miscarriage is the same as the standard of care for providing an abortion.\\n\\nThe way that can play out is if somebody has a miscarriage and they need to take medication to empty the uterus so they're not at risk of infection, that same medication is what's used for medication abortion. There have already been a lot of reports of pharmacists in Texas not filling those prescriptions for people who are suffering miscarriages.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nWhen the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion enshrined by Roe v. Wade last June, there were near-immediate consequences for women, children, and families: A 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion. Women were denied care while having miscarriages due in part to confusion among health providers. Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Miscarriage care already being impacted in Texas.\n    Event 2: 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

It also averts a court battle that was set to take place if the acquisition did not close by 5 p.m. ET Friday. But Musk\u2019s takeover now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it. Musk on Thursday fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Neg Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to two sources familiar with the situation. He also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter\u2019s general counsel, a source told CNN.\\nDespite multiple news outlets confirming the changes Thursday night, Twitter staff had still not formally been informed of the changes as of Friday morning, two Twitter employees told CNN.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter.\\n\\nJoining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks. Calling the decision \"a serious jolt to the legal system,\" he said that both the majority and dissent displayed \"a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share.\"\n    Article B: \\n\\nIn the summer of 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden faced allegations of hypocrisy and \"flip-flopping\" after he strongly condemned the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access.\\n\\nSpeaking on June 24, Biden described Roe as \"the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy,\" and he called the decision to overturn it a \"tragic error\" and the \"realization of an extreme ideology.\"\\n\\nHowever, many observers \u2014 both to the left and right of Biden on the ideological spectrum \u2014 contrasted such remarks, in 2022, with what they presented as Biden\\'s very different stance on the abortion rights landmark, four decades ago.\\n\\nOn June 24, one Facebook user published a viral post which contained a screenshot of an article by the London Independent, with the headline \"Biden voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 1982...\" and the caption \"Wonder how those protesting the Supreme Court decision feel about this. Chances are they are the same people that voted for Biden.\"\\n\\nIn recent years, the same core claim \u2014 that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress \u2014 has featured in news articles by the The New York Times, Fox News, and the New York Post.\\n\\nThat claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is \"True.\"\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: June 24, 2022: Supreme Court rules 6-3 to uphold Mississippi's law, with the decision to overturn Roe a 5-4 vote.\n    Event 2: A viral Facebook post claimed that Biden voted to overturn Roe v.

That includes INPE itself, whose leader, Ricardo Magnus Os\u00f3rio Galv\u00e3o, was canned this month because \u2014 according to Galv\u00e3o \u2014 he questioned how Bolsonaro was using his agency's data.\\n\\nAsked about the fires by local media, Bolsonaro baselessly suggested that nongovernmental organizations have been setting the fires themselves as retaliation for the scaling back of Brazil's usual funding support for them. \n    Article B: \\n\\nInternational pressure may be the only way to stop the Brazilian government from taking a \u201csuicide\u201d path in the Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most respected scientists has said, as the world\u2019s biggest rainforest continues to be ravaged by thousands of deliberate fires.\\n\\nThe large number of conflagrations \u2013 set illegally to clear and prepare land for crops, cattle and property speculation \u2013 has prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency, created giant smoke clouds that have drifted hundreds of miles, and sparked international concerns about the destruction of an essential carbon sink.\\n\\n\u201cOur house is burning,\u201d tweeted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who called for emergency talks on the subject at this week\u2019s G7 summit. But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d.

Russia used to supply 40% of Europe\u2019s natural gas, and even more to Germany, where inexpensive energy was a pillar of the economy.\\n\\nThere\u2019s still some Russian gas flowing to Europe through a pipeline passing through Ukraine into Slovakia, and another crossing the Black Sea to Turkey and then to EU member Bulgaria. Russia started cutting back gas as early as last summer, before the war in Ukraine started. That sent gas prices sharply higher.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister is reportedly preparing to commit as much as \u00a3150 billion ($172 billion) to shield households and businesses from soaring energy bills, increasing government borrowing at a time when investors are already on edge about the country\u2019s finances.\\n\\nLiz Truss, who earlier this week succeeded Boris Johnson, told lawmakers Wednesday that she would unveil her plans to tackle sky-high energy prices on Thursday.\\n\\nTruss is drawing up plans to freeze the average annual energy bill for households at around \u00a32,500 ($2,860) for the next two years, the Financial Times reported. That would mean bills rising by 27% from their current level, but keep them well below the \u00a33,549 ($3,954) they would hit starting in October without government intervention.\\n\\nIt will be expensive. The FT reported that the plan could include \u00a390 billion ($103 billion) in support to households, and up to \u00a360 billion ($69 billion) for businesses, the FT said.\\n\\nIf so, that would outstrip the amount the government spent subsidizing the salaries of millions of workers during the pandemic to prevent mass layoffs by a whopping \u00a380 billion ($91 billion).

UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI.

Trouble is, the software provider supplied a patch back in March that should have eliminated that vulnerability. But Equifax's former CEO (who suddenly retired last week) told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that a single IT technician was at fault for the whole thing after they failed to install the patch.\\n\\nWhile speaking to the committee (video below), former CEO Richard Smith outlined the company's normal procedure for new patches: Have a technician install it and then scan the system for any remaining vulnerabilities. Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed.\\n\\nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability.\\n\\nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser.\n    Article B: \\n\\nThe chief executive of Equifax is retiring, the company said Tuesday, just weeks after the troubled credit reporting agency disclosed that it had suffered a massive data breach affecting as many as 143 million people.\\n\\nThe departure of Richard Smith comes as Equifax has drawn fire from countless consumers and dozens of federal lawmakers over its handling of the breach.

The company also faces multiple federal investigations over its handling of the hack and reports that executives sold an unusual amount of stock before the breach was publicly disclosed.\\n\\nEquifax's board of directors appointed board member Mark Feidler to serve as the company's nonexecutive chairman, the company said in a statement Tuesday.

Watching him begin to reshape content moderation and launch a poorly considered monetization scheme would be entertaining if their potential effects weren\u2019t so dire, with consequences for Twitter\u2019s employees and users, and potentially the broader society. \\n\\nOriginally reported Sunday by The Verge, a plan to charge verified users to get or keep their blue checks was expected to cost $20 a month. But after widespread backlash on the platform and a poll tweeted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, in which nearly 82% of users responded that they wouldn\u2019t pay anything for verification, those plans appear to have changed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Musk had posted a thread on the platform outlining his plan to charge $8 a month instead \u2014 part of an overhaul of Twitter\u2019s existing Blue service.\\n\\nAlong with the coveted blue check, Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to post longer video and audio clips. They will also have half as many ads in their feeds and be able to get around paywalls from news publishers \u201cwilling to work\u201d with the platform, and their tweets will get priority in replies, mentions and search results.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that such a plan could have a number of drawbacks.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion. Advertisers concerned about their brand have left the platform, leading to plummeting revenues for the company in recent months.\n\n    Event 1: Musk changed the plan to charge users $8 a month for verification.\n    Event 2: Twitter's value is half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

Though still an imperfect customs union and relegated to marginal status during the tenure of Lula\u2019s predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Mercosur delivered a combined GDP of over $5 trillion in 2022, making the bloc the world\u2019s fifth largest economy.\\n\\nOther regional economic integration mechanisms include the creation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) in 2010, the Union of South America (Unasur) in 2008, and the Latin American Integration Association (Aladi) in 1980.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nDramatic elections in Brazil, Chile and Colombia brought leftist governments into power across much of Latin America in 2022, capping the region\\'s second \"pink tide\" in two decades.\\n\\n However, their struggles amid stubborn economic headwinds suggest the wave may have crested.

The far-right government of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez that followed unleashed the military on protesters, killing 30, persecuted those associated with the Morales government, threatened to privatize state industry, and disastrously mishandled the Covid-19 crisis. Yet just 12 months later, the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) returned, this time with Morales\u2019s former finance minister, Luis Arce, at the helm. With him, the commitment to a progressive agenda, albeit financed through expanding extractivism, has returned.  \\n\\nBy that time, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez had entered office in Argentina, ending a neoliberal reprise under Mauricio Macri. In Chile and Colombia, mass protests against inequality, neoliberalism, and repression at the hands of right-wing governments had begun to rattle the status quo. While six of the 11 countries that had elected left-leaning governments during the first 15 years of the 21st century remained in conservative hands, a new Left surge was building. \\n\\nSince 2018, voters in eight countries have chosen the Left. For Colombia and Mexico, these elections marked their first national left government of the 21st century; for Honduras, a previous shift to the left was cut short. Yet these groundbreaking wins are muddied by the outsized influence of the United States in these countries, largely because of Washington\u2019s preoccupation with its domestic issues of immigration and drugs.\n    Article B: \\n\\nGustavo Petro\u2019s upcoming inauguration on August 7 as Colombia\u2019s first left-wing president confirms an unmistakable trend in Latin American politics: Only five years after right-leaning leaders occupied presidential palaces in much of the region\u2014including Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico\u2014leftist candidates have won the vast majority of national elections and now govern all of the region\u2019s major countries except Brazil, where former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva holds a comfortable lead less than 100 days ahead of the presidential election.\\n\\nThis \u201cnew pink tide\u201d appears even more dominant than its predecessor in the 2000s that brought to power leaders like Argentina\u2019s Cristina Kirchner, Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales and Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. However, comparing the two cohorts reveals more differences than similarities.\\n\\nFirst, Latin American leaders in the mid-2000s enjoyed a commodity boom and, by the end of the decade, a significant U.S. interest rate reduction, which created an ideal macroeconomic environment for the region. These leaders were popular thanks to their increased public spending, and generally won reelection or succeeded in picking their successors.\\n\\nBy contrast, today\u2019s leaders face a perfect storm of rising U.S. interest rates, geopolitical instability and limited fiscal space after a devastating pandemic that hit Latin America particularly hard. They must be the bearers of bad news, and thus generally suffer lower approval ratings.

Wade overturned, the legal spotlight has shifted to the states, where abortion supporters and opponents must contend with 50 different constitutions that, in many places, guarantee rights more broadly than their federal counterpart.\\n\\nThe legal chaos has already begun. In a half-dozen states and counting, lawsuits argue that new restrictive abortion laws are in violation of state constitutions.\\n\\nSo, too, the stakes have grown for ballot measures scheduled this year to amend those constitutions, whether to protect the right to an abortion or eliminate it.\\n\\n\"For anyone who thought, \\'Oh, Roe v. Wade is done and now this whole thing is over\\' \u2014 I have bad news,\" Mary Ziegler, an abortion law expert at the University of California Davis, tells NPR. \"This is just going to be an even more complicated chapter that we\\'re entering into.\"\\n\\nAnd experts say the uncertainty could continue for years to come, given the relative ease of amending state constitutions and the judicial elections in many states that can result in rapid changes to a court\\'s ideological makeup.\\n\\nIn the days since the Dobbs decision, abortion rights organizations have filed lawsuits challenging state courts to find a right to abortion in at least four states, including Utah, Kentucky, Idaho and Mississippi.

Wade last June, there were near-immediate consequences for women, children, and families: A 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion. Women were denied care while having miscarriages due in part to confusion among health providers. Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Abortion rights organizations have filed lawsuits challenging state courts in at least four states.\n    Event 2: 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Protests are planned across the country to denounce the ruling.\n    Event 2: 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

I asked the buzzy artificial intelligence chatbot, which has ignited conversation in schools, corporate boardrooms and social media, to explain itself.\\n\\nIn its own description, ChatGPT is \u201can AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model. It uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to text inputs in a conversational manner.\u201d\\n\\nThe tool is the talk of the business world. It has been mentioned on earnings calls by management from a range of companies including oil giants, banks \u2014 and even the industrial behemoth Caterpillar.\\n\\nIt has also sparked concerns over potential abuses. In classrooms, students have used ChatGPT to generate entire essays, while hackers have begun testing it to write malicious code.\\n\\nSo what is ChatGPT, exactly? Here\u2019s a simple guide on all you need to know about the popular AI chatbot.\\n\\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by San Francisco-based startup OpenAI. OpenAI was co-founded in 2015 by Elon Musk and Sam Altman and is backed by well-known investors \u2014 most notably Microsoft. \\n\\nIt is one of several examples of generative AI. These are tools that allow users to enter written prompts and receive new human-like text or images and videos generated by the AI.\\n\\nPrior examples include Dall-E, a text-to-image program from OpenAI that garnered attention from people captivated by its ability to come up with realistic, often absurd, pictures that match people\u2019s text descriptions.\n    Article B: Microsoft\\n plans to release software to help large companies create their own chatbots similar to ChatGPT, CNBC has learned.\\n\\nIn the two months since startup OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, it has become a hit, impressing people with its ability to spit out comments on a wide variety of topics and in many styles. UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been working to incorporate OpenAI technologies into its own products. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it is augmenting Bing, its search engine, and Edge, its internet browser, with ChatGPT-like technology.\\n\\nIn addition, Microsoft plans to announce technology for companies, schools and governments to create their own bots with ChatGPT, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be named while discussing private plans. Microsoft imagines helping clients launch new chatbots or refine their existing ones with the new technology, which could suggest responses for call-center agents to use during customer service conversations, the person said.\\n\\nThe underlying artificial intelligence model of ChatGPT cannot currently provide substantial answers about anything that happened after 2021, because it hasn\u2019t been trained on recent information. \n\n    Event 1: It has sparked concerns over potential abuses, such as students using it to generate entire essays and hackers testing it to write malicious code.\n    Event 2: Microsoft plans to release software to help large companies create their own chatbots similar to ChatGPT.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

The acquisition was confirmed in an SEC filing from the company on Friday morning, noting it\u2019s delisting $TWTR from the New York Stock Exchange. He celebrated by firing executives. Musk fired Parag Agrawal, who succeeded Jack Dorsey as Twitter CEO, and chief financial officer Ned Segal, both of who were in the building at the time and escorted out by security, according to Reuters. Vijaya Gadde, the company\u2019s policy chief whom Musk had publicly criticized, was also ousted. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, is gone, too, The New York Times reports. (Bloomberg says security escorted him out, as well.) Chief customer officer Sarah Personette was not among the executives fired but announced she resigned on October 28th with a tweet thread posted the following Tuesday. In it, she mentions, \u201cI do believe the new administration understands the importance of holding up the standards of GARM.\u201d\\nThe execs were in line for handsome payouts for their trouble, Insider reports: Agrawal $38.7 million, Segal $25.4 million, Gadde $12.5 million, and Personette, who tweeted yesterday about how excited she was for Musk\u2019s takeover, $11.2 million. However, a subsequent report from The Information indicated Musk has said they\u2019re fired \u201cfor cause\u201d in an attempt to block them from receiving those payouts. It\u2019s unclear what this may mean for Personette.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

According to the agency, there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil so far this year \u2014 most of which erupted in the Amazon. That represents an astonishing leap of more than 80% over last year and by far the most that the agency has recorded since it began compiling this data in 2013.\\n\\nAbout half those fires, or nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018. Smoke from the fires has darkened the skies over major Brazilian cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo.\\n\\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has signaled unconcern about the situation. The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding. That includes INPE itself, whose leader, Ricardo Magnus Os\u00f3rio Galv\u00e3o, was canned this month because \u2014 according to Galv\u00e3o \u2014 he questioned how Bolsonaro was using his agency's data.\\n\\nAsked about the fires by local media, Bolsonaro baselessly suggested that nongovernmental organizations have been setting the fires themselves as retaliation for the scaling back of Brazil's usual funding support for them. \n    Article B: \\n\\nWildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest are driving a spike in breathing problems and hospitalizations among children in Brazil, according to a new report.\\n\\nThe fires, which have now been burning for months, are posing \u201ca major risk to the health of the population,\u201d said the report, published Wednesday by public health research institute Oswaldo Cruz Foundation.\\n\\nThe fires are releasing greenhouse gases like carbon monoxide and nitrous dioxide, as well as toxic pollutants like fine particulate matter (PM2.5), the report said. While the primary concern has been on their effect on the climate, these gases and pollutants can also aggravate heart disease and cause inflammation, nerve disorders, atherosclerosis, and even cancer.\\n\\nThe microscopic PM2.5 particles are especially dangerous \u2013 they\u2019re so small they can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream. In the short term they can cause inflammation and respiratory problems \u2013 in the long term, cancer and heart attacks.\\n\\nThese harmful effects are most visible in Brazil\u2019s \u201cArc of Deforestation,\u201d in the southern part of the rainforest where most of the burning is happening, the report said. In May and June about 5,000 children were hospitalized each month in this region \u2013 twice the expected number.\\n\\nCities closest to the fires saw a 36% increase in children\u2019s hospitalizations for respiratory diseases, the report found.\n\n    Event 1: Smoke from the fires has darkened the skies over major Brazilian cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo.\n    Event 2: The fires are releasing greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

{"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct":"Answer: C\n\nReasoning: The given evidence does not establish a direct causal link between Sarah Personette's resignation (Event 1) and the increase in hate speech on Twitter (Event 2). Personette's resignation occurred almost immediately after Musk took over Twitter and fired several top executives. Moreover, the text does not provide information about Personette's role in managing or moderating hate speech on the platform. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, it is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between the two events. A potential connection could exist given the context, such as changes in leadership or management following Musk's takeover, so answer C is the most appropriate choice.","label":"B","meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_label":"C","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\n    Context:\n    Article A: Elon Musk, Twitter\u2019s most important shitposter, has added the company to his business empire after months of legal skirmishes, according to CNBC, The Washington Post, and Insider. The acquisition was confirmed in an SEC filing from the company on Friday morning, noting it\u2019s delisting $TWTR from the New York Stock Exchange. He celebrated by firing executives. Musk fired Parag Agrawal, who succeeded Jack Dorsey as Twitter CEO, and chief financial officer Ned Segal, both of who were in the building at the time and escorted out by security, according to Reuters. Vijaya Gadde, the company\u2019s policy chief whom Musk had publicly criticized, was also ousted. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, is gone, too, The New York Times reports. (Bloomberg says security escorted him out, as well.) Chief customer officer Sarah Personette was not among the executives fired but announced she resigned on October 28th with a tweet thread posted the following Tuesday. In it, she mentions, \u201cI do believe the new administration understands the importance of holding up the standards of GARM.\u201d\\nThe execs were in line for handsome payouts for their trouble, Insider reports: Agrawal $38.7 million, Segal $25.4 million, Gadde $12.5 million, and Personette, who tweeted yesterday about how excited she was for Musk\u2019s takeover, $11.2 million. However, a subsequent report from The Information indicated Musk has said they\u2019re fired \u201cfor cause\u201d in an attempt to block them from receiving those payouts. It\u2019s unclear what this may mean for Personette.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion. Advertisers concerned about their brand have left the platform, leading to plummeting revenues for the company in recent months.\n\n    Event 1: Sarah Personette resigns.\n    Event 2: Increase in hate speech in Twitter\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

But Equifax's former CEO (who suddenly retired last week) told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that a single IT technician was at fault for the whole thing after they failed to install the patch.\\n\\nWhile speaking to the committee (video below), former CEO Richard Smith outlined the company's normal procedure for new patches: Have a technician install it and then scan the system for any remaining vulnerabilities. Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed.\\n\\nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability.\\n\\nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser.\n    Article B: \\n\\nVisa and MasterCard are issuing confidential alerts to financial institutions across the US, cautioning them that more than 200,000 credit cards were compromised in the recent Equifax data breach, according to PYMNTS. \\n\\nCompromised information included card account numbers, expiration dates, and cardholders\u2019 names, all of which can be used to conduct fraud at online retailers and perform identity theft.

The acquisition was confirmed in an SEC filing from the company on Friday morning, noting it\u2019s delisting $TWTR from the New York Stock Exchange. He celebrated by firing executives. Musk fired Parag Agrawal, who succeeded Jack Dorsey as Twitter CEO, and chief financial officer Ned Segal, both of who were in the building at the time and escorted out by security, according to Reuters. Vijaya Gadde, the company\u2019s policy chief whom Musk had publicly criticized, was also ousted. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, is gone, too, The New York Times reports. (Bloomberg says security escorted him out, as well.) Chief customer officer Sarah Personette was not among the executives fired but announced she resigned on October 28th with a tweet thread posted the following Tuesday. In it, she mentions, \u201cI do believe the new administration understands the importance of holding up the standards of GARM.\u201d\\nThe execs were in line for handsome payouts for their trouble, Insider reports: Agrawal $38.7 million, Segal $25.4 million, Gadde $12.5 million, and Personette, who tweeted yesterday about how excited she was for Musk\u2019s takeover, $11.2 million. However, a subsequent report from The Information indicated Musk has said they\u2019re fired \u201cfor cause\u201d in an attempt to block them from receiving those payouts. It\u2019s unclear what this may mean for Personette.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

The decision is expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states in the nation.\\n\\n\n    Article B: \\n\\nWhen the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion enshrined by Roe v. Wade last June, there were near-immediate consequences for women, children, and families: A 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion. Women were denied care while having miscarriages due in part to confusion among health providers. Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe, formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: May 2, 2022: Politico report details leaked Supreme Court draft opinion indicating the Court would overturn Roe v.

But for now, here are the main reasons experts believed SVB failed.\\n\\nThe Vermont senator Bernie Sanders argues that the culprit was an \u201cabsurd\u201d 2018 law, supported by Congress and signed by Donald Trump, that undid some of the credit requirements imposed under the Dodd-Frank banking legislation brought in after the 2008 banking crisis.\\n\\nDodd-Frank required that banks with at least $50bn in assets \u2013 banks considered \u201csystemically important\u201d \u2013 undergo an annual Federal Reserve \u201cstress test\u201d and maintain certain levels of capital as well as plans for a living will if they failed.\\n\\nSVB\u2019s chief executive, Greg Becker, argued before Congress in 2015 that the $50bn threshold (SVB held $40bn at the time) was unnecessary and his bank, like other \u201cmid-sized\u201d or regional banks, \u201cdoes not present systemic risks\u201d.\\n\\nTrump said the new bill went a \u201clong way toward fixing\u201d Dodd-Frank, which he called a \u201cjob-killer\u201d. \n    Article B: On Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank was a well-capitalized institution seeking to raise some funds.\\n\\nWithin 48 hours, a panic induced by the very venture capital community that SVB had served and nurtured ended the bank\u2019s 40-year-run.\\n\\nRegulators shuttered SVB Friday and seized its deposits in the largest U.S. banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis and the second-largest ever. The company\u2019s downward spiral began late Wednesday, when it surprised investors with news that it needed to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its balance sheet. What followed was the rapid collapse of a highly-respected bank that had grown alongside its technology clients.\\n\\nEven now, as the dust begins to settle on the second bank wind-down announced this week, members of the VC community are lamenting the role that other investors played in SVB\u2019s demise.\\n\\n\u201cThis was a hysteria-induced bank run caused by VCs,\u201d Ryan Falvey, a fintech investor at Restive Ventures, told CNBC. \u201cThis is going to go down as one of the ultimate cases of an industry cutting its nose off to spite its face.\u201d\\n\\nThe episode is the latest fallout from the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to stem inflation with its most aggressive rate hiking campaign in four decades. The ramifications could be far-reaching, with concerns that startups may be unable to pay employees in coming days, venture investors may struggle to raise funds, and an already-battered sector could face a deeper malaise.\n\n    Event 1: In 2018 a law was passed for banks to not be required to have a $50bn safety capital.\n    Event 2: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is shut down by regulators.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

According to the agency, there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil so far this year \u2014 most of which erupted in the Amazon. That represents an astonishing leap of more than 80% over last year and by far the most that the agency has recorded since it began compiling this data in 2013.\n\nAbout half those fires, or nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018. Smoke from the fires has darkened the skies over major Brazilian cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has signaled unconcern about the situation. The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding. That includes INPE itself, whose leader, Ricardo Magnus Os\u00f3rio Galv\u00e3o, was canned this month because \u2014 according to Galv\u00e3o \u2014 he questioned how Bolsonaro was using his agency's data.\n\nAsked about the fires by local media, Bolsonaro baselessly suggested that nongovernmental organizations have been setting the fires themselves as retaliation for the scaling back of Brazil's usual funding support for them. \n    Article B: \n\nInternational pressure may be the only way to stop the Brazilian government from taking a \u201csuicide\u201d path in the Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most respected scientists has said, as the world\u2019s biggest rainforest continues to be ravaged by thousands of deliberate fires.\n\nThe large number of conflagrations \u2013 set illegally to clear and prepare land for crops, cattle and property speculation \u2013 has prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency, created giant smoke clouds that have drifted hundreds of miles, and sparked international concerns about the destruction of an essential carbon sink.\n\n\u201cOur house is burning,\u201d tweeted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who called for emergency talks on the subject at this week\u2019s G7 summit. But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d. Asked about the fires, he declined to comment but reportedly said Bolsonaro\u2019s government had \u201clegitimate ambitions to bring prosperity to its people\u201d.\n\nScientists say the ongoing destruction will have dire consequences for Brazil and the world.\n\n\n\n    Event 1: The Brazilian President has scaled back environmental regulations and funding for environmental agencies.\n    Event 2: Thousands of deliberate fires are ravaging the Amazon rainforest.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

Wade on Friday, declaring that the constitutional right to abortion, upheld for nearly a half century, no longer exists.\\n\\nWriting for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1973 Roe ruling and repeated subsequent high court decisions reaffirming Roe \"must be overruled\" because they were \"egregiously wrong,\" the arguments \"exceptionally weak\" and so \"damaging\" that they amounted to \"an abuse of judicial authority.\"\\n\\nThe decision, most of which was leaked in early May, means that abortion rights will be rolled back in nearly half of the states immediately, with more restrictions likely to follow. For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country. The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter.\\n\\nJoining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks.

That month, there was a 48% decrease in abortions in Idaho, amounting to 70 fewer abortions. In Oregon over that time period there was an 18% increase in abortions, or 150 more.

Its story features women and men who have spoken out \u2014 including activist Tarana Burke, who started the hashtag 10 years ago.\n\n#MeToo rose to prominence as a social media campaign in the wake of high-profile accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. After actress Alyssa Milano popularized the hashtag, thousands of women began sharing their stories about the pervasive damage wrought by sexual harassment and by open secrets about abuse.\n\nThe movement's empowering reach could be seen in the platform on which Time announced its choice: the Today show.

The firm\\'s source, per one report, is believed to be Equifax.\\n\\nApache Struts is a popular open-source software programming Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for Java. It is not, as some headlines have had it, a vendor software program.\\n\\nIt\\'s also not proven that Struts was the source of the hole the hackers drove through.\\n\\nIn fact, several headlines -- some of which have since been retracted -- all source a single quote by a non-technical analyst from an Equifax source.\\n\\nNot only is that troubling journalistically, it\\'s problematic from a technical point of view.

Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed.\\n\\nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability.\\n\\nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser.\n\n    Event 1: Equifax was using the open-source server framework, Apache Struts.\n    Event 2: Equifax failed to fix vulnerability within 48 hours.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

They will also have half as many ads in their feeds and be able to get around paywalls from news publishers \u201cwilling to work\u201d with the platform, and their tweets will get priority in replies, mentions and search results.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that such a plan could have a number of drawbacks.\n\n    Event 1: Lawsuits filed against Twitter for allegedly failing to give 60-day warning of mass layoffs\n    Event 2: Musk proposed a plan to charge verified users $20 a month for verification.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been working to incorporate OpenAI technologies into its own products. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it is augmenting Bing, its search engine, and Edge, its internet browser, with ChatGPT-like technology.\\n\\nIn addition, Microsoft plans to announce technology for companies, schools and governments to create their own bots with ChatGPT, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be named while discussing private plans. Microsoft imagines helping clients launch new chatbots or refine their existing ones with the new technology, which could suggest responses for call-center agents to use during customer service conversations, the person said.\\n\\nThe underlying artificial intelligence model of ChatGPT cannot currently provide substantial answers about anything that happened after 2021, because it hasn\u2019t been trained on recent information. \n    Article B: OpenAI has launched its first subscription plan for ChatGPT, opening up the popular AI model for premium use just two months after its public launch.\\n\\nThe new plan, called ChatGPT Plus and announced in a company blog post on Wednesday, will charge subscribers $20 for monthly use of ChatGPT\u2019s tools. Users will get priority access to ChatGPT \u201cduring peak times,\u201d faster responses and \u201cpriority access to new features and improvements,\u201d the company wrote. The subscription is only available initially in the United States and will roll out to a waitlist first.\\n\\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement. The company also noted in its post that a waitlist is now available for an upcoming ChatGPT API.\\n\\nThe move comes just weeks after OpenAI president and chairman Greg Brockman posted to the company\u2019s official Discord server asking users for input on ways to \u201cmonetize ChatGPT.\u201d Some users (including this author) reported seeing an offer for a $42 per month pro tier in January, which promised early and priority access to new features and better reliability should the service, which has suffered repeated outages due to high demand in past weeks, again hit capacity.\\n\\nAfter OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late November, more than one million users overwhelmed the tool\u2019s site within five days, OpenAI has said. Since then, product releases and other announcements have flowed fast out of the San Francisco-based company led by CEO Sam Altman.\n\n    Event 1: Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is augmenting Bing and Edge with ChatGPT-like technology.\n    Event 2: OpenAI launches subscription plan for ChatGPT\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.
