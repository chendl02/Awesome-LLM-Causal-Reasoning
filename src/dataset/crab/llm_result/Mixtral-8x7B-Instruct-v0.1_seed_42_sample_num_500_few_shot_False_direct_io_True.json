But after widespread backlash on the platform and a poll tweeted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, in which nearly 82% of users responded that they wouldn\u2019t pay anything for verification, those plans appear to have changed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Musk had posted a thread on the platform outlining his plan to charge $8 a month instead \u2014 part of an overhaul of Twitter\u2019s existing Blue service.\\n\\nAlong with the coveted blue check, Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to post longer video and audio clips. They will also have half as many ads in their feeds and be able to get around paywalls from news publishers \u201cwilling to work\u201d with the platform, and their tweets will get priority in replies, mentions and search results.\\n\\nIt should come as no surprise that such a plan could have a number of drawbacks.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde.

For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country.

Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks.

{"mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1":" Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nWhile Event 1 and Event 2 both concern the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they are not causally related. Event 1 refers to a vote cast by Joe Biden, then a senator, on a proposal in 1982 that would have allowed individual states to restrict or prohibit abortion, while Event 2 describes the official reversal of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022.\n\nThe timing of these events does not suggest a causal connection. Event 1 occurred nearly 40 years before Event 2, and there were many other events and efforts during that period aimed at challenging and overturning Roe v. Wade, including numerous court cases, legislative actions, and public protests.\n\nMoreover, Event 2 is the result of a complex legal process involving the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, which is independent of senators' votes and other political actions. It is unlikely that a single vote cast by a senator in 1982 would have had a direct impact on the Court's decision in 2022.\n\nOverall, while Events 1 and 2 are related in the broad sense that they both deal with the issue of abortion rights, they are not causally related, and other factors and events were likely more significant in causing Event 2 to occur.

For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country. The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter.\\n\\nJoining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

However, the connection cannot be completely ruled out since Weinstein's sacking might have contributed to raising awareness about the issue.\n\nBackground info also suggests a low causal connection, as the #MeToo movement was initially created by activist Tarana Burke in 2006, well before Weinstein's case came to light.

There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money.

Residents in the U.K. and Canada were also impacted.\\n\\nThe breach occurred between mid-May and July, Equifax said. The company said it discovered the hack on July 29.\\n\\nThe data breach is one of the worst ever, by its reach and by the kind of information exposed to the public.\\n\\n\"This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do,\" said Equifax chairman and CEO Richard F. Smith.\\n\\nEquifax is one of three nationwide credit-reporting companies that track and rates the financial history of U.S. consumers. The companies are supplied with data about loans, loan payments and credit cards, as well as information on everything from child support payments, credit limits, missed rent and utilities payments, addresses and employer history, which all factor into credit scores.\\n\\nUnlike other data breaches, not all of the people affected by the Equifax breach may be aware that they\\'re customers of the company. \n\n    Event 1: DHS CERT sent Equifax notice about vulnerability on March 8th.\n    Event 2: Equifax reports a massive cybersecurity breach that compromised the personal information of up to 143 million Americans.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

In July, Musk decided he no longer wanted to buy Twitter and attempted to call off the purchase, claiming that Twitter did not comply with its contractual obligations and that he was not provided with the relevant business information that he requested.

He has weakened environmental agencies and regulations, which likely contributes to the surge in deforestation rates. Additionally, the firing of INPE's director due to his disagreement with Bolsonaro about using data further supports the link between the far-right Brazilian president and increased deforestation.

The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding.

Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away.

Burke's early efforts created a foundation for the hashtag, making it possible for a wider audience to recognize and use it.\n\n2. Although Burke's campaign took time to gain traction, Alyssa Milano popularized it in response to the Harvey Weinstein allegations, bringing significant attention to the issue. The fact remains, however, that Burke's early initiative provided the concept and inspiration for Milano's social media activation.\n\nThese points suggest that Event 1 likely contributed to Event 2, but there may have also been other contributing factors. For example, the high-profile nature of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, the rise of social media as a platform for activism, and the increased willingness of women to share their experiences may have all played a role in launching #MeToo into the mainstream. Because of this, the extra context suggests the causal connection is not absolute, falling more in the medium range.","label":"C","mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1_label":"B","prompt":"You are a highly intelligent question-answering bot with profound knowledge of causal inference.\n    Context:\n    Article A: \\n\\nIt has created a wave of awareness and brave confrontations over sexual harassment and assault, taking down powerful men in the process.

The purpose is to try and determine if there is a significant difference in volatility between the two.\\n\\n While the 2017-2020 movements have been relatively similar, ETH has increased at a much faster rate in 2021.\\n\\nBetween 2017 and 2020, the movement has been relatively similar for both assets.\\n\\nMeasuring from the all-time high of early 2018, BTC corrected for a 363 day period, losing 84% of its value in the process. On the other hand, ETH corrected for 336 days, losing 94% of its value. Therefore, while the ETH correction was sharper and lasted for a shorter period of time, there was not a pronounced difference between the two.\\n\\nFollowing this, BTC increased by 330% in 191 days, while ETH moved upwards by 290% in 197 days. This somewhat made up for the difference from the sharper ETH fall preceding this upward movement.\\n\\nFinally, BTC decreased by 71.50% in 261 days leading up to the March 2020 bottom, while ETH decreased by 66.50% in 259 days, with very similar rates of decrease.\\n\\nUnlike the 2017-2020 period, there is a significant difference in the movement of both assets in 2021.\\n\\nMeasuring from the March 2020 bottom, BTC increased by 1,520% in 398 days. While this is a formidable rate of increase, ETH more than doubled it by increasing 3,620% in 430 days.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: NFTs are mostly built on Ethereum's blockchain.\n    Event 2: In 2021, BTC increased by 1,520% in 398 days, while ETH increased by 3,620% in 430 days.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

{"mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1":" Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\n\nAlthough both events are related to the topic of abortion and the political stance of President Biden and conservatives, it is not possible to determine the exact degree of causality without further information. Event 1 occurred nearly 40 years before the current survey (Event 2), and many factors might have influenced the opinion of conservatives on the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Voting patterns, political ideologies, and societal changes over the years contribute to the complex relationship between these two events. Hence, attributing Event 2 solely or predominantly to Event 1 would not be accurate; instead, Event 1 might have had a minimal or subtle influence on the opinions of today's conservatives.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of opinions within each political group; not all conservatives would have shifted their stance due to Event 1, and some might hold different views despite Biden's past voting records.

The acquisition was confirmed in an SEC filing from the company on Friday morning, noting it\u2019s delisting $TWTR from the New York Stock Exchange. He celebrated by firing executives. Musk fired Parag Agrawal, who succeeded Jack Dorsey as Twitter CEO, and chief financial officer Ned Segal, both of who were in the building at the time and escorted out by security, according to Reuters. Vijaya Gadde, the company\u2019s policy chief whom Musk had publicly criticized, was also ousted. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, is gone, too, The New York Times reports. (Bloomberg says security escorted him out, as well.) Chief customer officer Sarah Personette was not among the executives fired but announced she resigned on October 28th with a tweet thread posted the following Tuesday. In it, she mentions, \u201cI do believe the new administration understands the importance of holding up the standards of GARM.\u201d\\nThe execs were in line for handsome payouts for their trouble, Insider reports: Agrawal $38.7 million, Segal $25.4 million, Gadde $12.5 million, and Personette, who tweeted yesterday about how excited she was for Musk\u2019s takeover, $11.2 million. However, a subsequent report from The Information indicated Musk has said they\u2019re fired \u201cfor cause\u201d in an attempt to block them from receiving those payouts. It\u2019s unclear what this may mean for Personette.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

{"mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1":" Answer: A\nExplanation: The new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is documented to have weakened environmental regulations, dismissed the head of INPE (National Institute for Space Research), and shown indifference toward the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. These actions and overall disdain for environmental preservation have likely contributed to the increase in fires and deforestation, leading to the state of Amazonas declaring a state of emergency and the creation of giant smoke clouds.

According to the agency, there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil so far this year \u2014 most of which erupted in the Amazon. That represents an astonishing leap of more than 80% over last year and by far the most that the agency has recorded since it began compiling this data in 2013.\\n\\nAbout half those fires, or nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018.

The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding. That includes INPE itself, whose leader, Ricardo Magnus Os\u00f3rio Galv\u00e3o, was canned this month because \u2014 according to Galv\u00e3o \u2014 he questioned how Bolsonaro was using his agency's data.\\n\\nAsked about the fires by local media, Bolsonaro baselessly suggested that nongovernmental organizations have been setting the fires themselves as retaliation for the scaling back of Brazil's usual funding support for them. \n    Article B: \\n\\nInternational pressure may be the only way to stop the Brazilian government from taking a \u201csuicide\u201d path in the Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most respected scientists has said, as the world\u2019s biggest rainforest continues to be ravaged by thousands of deliberate fires.\\n\\nThe large number of conflagrations \u2013 set illegally to clear and prepare land for crops, cattle and property speculation \u2013 has prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency, created giant smoke clouds that have drifted hundreds of miles, and sparked international concerns about the destruction of an essential carbon sink.\\n\\n\u201cOur house is burning,\u201d tweeted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who called for emergency talks on the subject at this week\u2019s G7 summit. But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d.

Event 2 occurred nearly four decades before the Supreme Court's decision and was influenced by factors beyond the political composition of the Supreme Court. Biden's vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in 1982 does not directly link to Trump's appointments, which are the primary focus of Event 1.

It\u2019s unclear what this may mean for Personette.\n    Article B: It\u2019s been five months since Elon Musk took over Twitter after a long-drawn out, tumultuous negotiating period. There has been a lot of controversy since he positioned himself at the helm of the social media platform, including massive layoffs, allowing too-long tweets, and altering the algorithm to make his Super Bowl tweets rank higher. He closed the deal to acquire Twitter on Oct. 28, after paying his original officer price of $54.20 a share for a grand total of approximately $44 billion. He fired some of the company\u2019s top executives almost immediately, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and chief legal officer Vijay Gadde. Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

The actions of the Brazilian president and his administration have led to diminished staff and funding for environmental agencies, which has likely contributed to the lack of oversight and prevention measures. As a result, the number of fires has escalated, which in turn causes deforestation (An acre of forest can be clear-cut in as little as 2 minutes with a chain saw).

Soon after, he began to lay off staff members to remove around half of the 7,500-strong workforce. Twitter value drops to half of Musk\u2019s acquisition price. Now, it appears that Twitter is facing financial challenges. Changes since Musk\u2019s takeover have resulted in more hate speech, issues in acquiring blue check verification, and problems with the app\u2019s features. According to Zoe Schiffer, managing editor of Platformer, a tech news website, the billionaire sent an email to Twitter employees admitting that the company has been through radical changes which were necessary. Musk also reportedly acknowledged that the platform was previously about four months from running out of money. Per Schiffer, the value of Twitter is now half of what Musk paid for it. \u201cCurrent grants are based on a $20b valuation,\u201d she tweeted, although Musk says he is hopeful of eventually getting a valuation of $250 billion.

Twitter in turn filed a lawsuit to force Musk to go on with the sale, accusing him of trashing the company, disrupting its operations, and destroying stockholder value.

The company says this update is another milestone in the advancement of AI. The new technology has the potential to improve how people learn new languages, how blind people process images, and even how we do our taxes.\\n\\nOpenAI also claims that the new model supports a chatbot that\u2019s more factual, creative, concise, and can understand images, instead of just text.\\n\\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, called GPT-4 \u201cour most capable and aligned model yet.\u201d He also cautioned that \u201cit is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it\u201d\n\n    Event 1: OpenAI was co-founded in 2015 by Elon Musk and Sam Altman and is backed by well-known investors \u2014 most notably Microsoft.\n    Event 2: ChatGPT or GPT-3.5 has been released by OpenAI.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\\n\\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children.\\n\\nOther reverberations from the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v.

By signaling unconcern about environmental protection and weakening environmental agencies, the President has created a climate that has allowed for the alarming increase in fires.

According to the agency, there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil so far this year \u2014 most of which erupted in the Amazon. That represents an astonishing leap of more than 80% over last year and by far the most that the agency has recorded since it began compiling this data in 2013.\n\nAbout half those fires, or nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018. Smoke from the fires has darkened the skies over major Brazilian cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has signaled unconcern about the situation. The far-right leader, who took office in January, has repeatedly lambasted Brazil's environmental regulations as an impediment to economic development, and under his tenure environmental agencies have seen diminished staff and funding. That includes INPE itself, whose leader, Ricardo Magnus Os\u00f3rio Galv\u00e3o, was canned this month because \u2014 according to Galv\u00e3o \u2014 he questioned how Bolsonaro was using his agency's data.\n\nAsked about the fires by local media, Bolsonaro baselessly suggested that nongovernmental organizations have been setting the fires themselves as retaliation for the scaling back of Brazil's usual funding support for them. \n    Article B: \n\nInternational pressure may be the only way to stop the Brazilian government from taking a \u201csuicide\u201d path in the Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most respected scientists has said, as the world\u2019s biggest rainforest continues to be ravaged by thousands of deliberate fires.\n\nThe large number of conflagrations \u2013 set illegally to clear and prepare land for crops, cattle and property speculation \u2013 has prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency, created giant smoke clouds that have drifted hundreds of miles, and sparked international concerns about the destruction of an essential carbon sink.\n\n\u201cOur house is burning,\u201d tweeted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who called for emergency talks on the subject at this week\u2019s G7 summit. But the response to the crisis has been mixed: while Norway and Germany have halted donations to the Brazilian government\u2019s Amazon fund, the EU has recently signed a trade deal with South America, and the UK spent this week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UK trade minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his counterparts in Brasilia and declaring a desire to \u201cdeepen relations\u201d.

{"mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1":" Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the articles provided, Event 1 (Equifax was using the open-source server framework, Apache Struts) does increase the likelihood that Event 2 (Equifax failed to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours) might have occurred. This is because the vulnerability exploited by the hackers was in Apache Struts, and Equifax did not fix it within 48 hours after receiving the notice.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that using Apache Struts does not automatically imply that a vulnerability exists or that it will not be fixed promptly. The vulnerability in question became an issue only because Equifax did not install the patch provided by Apache in March. Therefore, while Event 1 sets the stage for Event 2, it does not entirely cause Event 2, and other factors (such as Equifax's internal processes or the actions of their IT team) likely also played a significant role.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: B, or Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.

The firm\\'s source, per one report, is believed to be Equifax.\\n\\nApache Struts is a popular open-source software programming Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for Java. It is not, as some headlines have had it, a vendor software program.\\n\\nIt\\'s also not proven that Struts was the source of the hole the hackers drove through.\\n\\nIn fact, several headlines -- some of which have since been retracted -- all source a single quote by a non-technical analyst from an Equifax source.\\n\\nNot only is that troubling journalistically, it\\'s problematic from a technical point of view. In case you haven\\'t noticed, Equifax appears to be utterly and completely clueless about their own technology.

But Equifax's former CEO (who suddenly retired last week) told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that a single IT technician was at fault for the whole thing after they failed to install the patch.\\n\\nWhile speaking to the committee (video below), former CEO Richard Smith outlined the company's normal procedure for new patches: Have a technician install it and then scan the system for any remaining vulnerabilities. Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed.\\n\\nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability.\\n\\nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser.\n\n    Event 1: Equifax was using the open-source server framework, Apache Struts.\n    Event 2: Equifax failed to fix vulnerability within 48 hours.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

Amini was accused of violating the country\u2019s law on headscarves.\\n\\nIran\u2019s security forces said that upon her arrest, Amini was taken to a detention center where she received training on hijab rules, and it was there that she collapsed from a heart attack.\n    Article B: \\n\\nThe US is expected to issue new sanctions this week against law enforcement officials and those directly involved in the crackdown on protests in Iran, a source familiar with the planned movement told CNN.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden, who has moved quickly to throw his support behind the demonstrators, issued an intentionally vague statement Monday promising further costs \u201con perpetrators of violence against peaceful protestors.\u201d A source told CNN those costs are expected to be in the form of additional sanctions this week, with more action to potentially follow.\\n\\nThe massive protests sweeping Iran were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by morality police on September 13 after being accused of violating the country\u2019s conservative dress code. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, Biden alluded to the protests over her death and said the US stood with the \u201cbrave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.\u201d\\n\\nDays later, the US announced sanctions on Iran\u2019s morality police \u201cfor abuse and violence against Iranian women and the violation of the rights of peaceful Iranian protestors.\u201d\\n\\nThe effort to move quickly to respond to the protests sweeping Iran comes after some top officials in the Biden administration acknowledged that the US was too slow to respond when protests erupted in Iran in 2009. Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser who served in the Obama administration, told NBC recently that officials were concerned about undermining the protesters instead of aiding them.\\n\\n\n\n    Event 1: Her family and protestors across Iran accuse the government of covering up her murder.\n    Event 2: Joe Biden expresses his support behind the demonstrators.\n\n    How much did event 1 cause event 2 to happen?\n    [A] High causality: Event 1 is definitely responsible for Event 2.\n    [B] Medium causality: Event 1 might have been responsible for Event 2.\n    [C] Low causality: The context gives a little indication that there is a connection between the two events, but background info might suggest a low causal connection.\n    [D] No causality: Events are somehow related but definitely NOT causally related.\n    Give me the anwser directly Answer: A, or Answer: B, or Answer: C, or Answer: D.

{"mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1":" Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe two events are not causally related. The lawsuits regarding the lack of 60-day warning for mass layoffs (Event 1) occurred on Thursday, while Musk's announcement about charging verified users $20 a month for verification (Event 2) was originally reported on Sunday.

But after widespread backlash on the platform and a poll tweeted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, in which nearly 82% of users responded that they wouldn\u2019t pay anything for verification, those plans appear to have changed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Musk had posted a thread on the platform outlining his plan to charge $8 a month instead \u2014 part of an overhaul of Twitter\u2019s existing Blue service.\\n\\nAlong with the coveted blue check, Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to post longer video and audio clips.

{"mistralai\/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1":" Answer: C\n\nThe context provides some indications that there is a connection between the two events, but it does not directly suggest a strong causal relationship. Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and integration of OpenAI's technology into their products might contribute to the overall success and stability of OpenAI, which in turn enables them to monetize ChatGPT effectively through a subscription plan. However, other factors like the high demand and popularity of ChatGPT could also have contributed to the decision of launching the subscription plan.
