While plastic can melt given enough time and water temperature, it would usually take longer than the scenario involving the hot stove. However, if the water was extremely hot or if the container was soaked for an extended period, melting could still be possible.\n\nConsidering our reasoning and the two possible scenarios, the more immediate and likely cause for the plastic container melting, based on the provided premise, would be placing the container on a hot stove (B).

Here, the flat tire may impact the bicycle's mobility, as it would be difficult or impossible to ride the bike with an under-inflated tire.\n\nAmong the possible actions that could be taken to address this issue are:\n1. Adding air to the tire (pumping air) to restore its shape and pressure, thus improving mobility.\n2. Changing the gears on the bicycle, but this wouldn't directly help fix a flat tire.\n\nGiven the initial premise, we can safely conclude that pumping air into the tire (A) would likely be the effect to restore mobility after discovering a flat tire. However, it's important to remember that not everyone might respond in the same way when faced with a flat tire.
