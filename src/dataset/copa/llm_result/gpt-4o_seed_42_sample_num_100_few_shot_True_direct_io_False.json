However, underwater incidents typically don't cause the kind of damage that would lead to permanent hearing loss.\n\n- Option B, \"He was nearly killed in an explosion,\" is a well-documented cause of hearing loss.

If the woman's sister is happy, this could provoke feelings of envy in the woman if she is not experiencing similar happiness.\n\n- Option B, \"Her sister got divorced,\" is less likely to cause envy. Divorce is generally considered a challenging life event and not typically something envied by others.

Changing hair color is often associated with a desire for personal transformation or experimentation with appearance.\n- Option B, \"She wanted to blend in,\" seems less likely as a direct cause, as dyeing hair can make a person stand out more depending on the color and context.

A gambler feeling confident is more likely to make big bets based on their belief in winning.\n\n- Option B, \"He went home broke,\" is a possible outcome of gambling but not directly tied to the gambler's confidence.
